  Data structures, algorithms and code constructs you'll need for your interview
 </h1>
 <p>
  Throughout this course we've talked about several data structures and algorithms you'll need to have in your toolbox as you approach an interview.  Here we're providing a list of the most important ones.  You should probably know how to (1) use, (2) implement, and (3) analyze the running time of all of the data structures and algorithms listed below.  This is not an exhaustive list by any means, and if you know of more, please post them in the forum.  If the post gains enough momentum, we'll pin it to the top.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of these concepts are covered to some degree in the previous courses in our specialization, but it never hurts to find other sources and study them as much as possible.  And don't try to "just memorize" anything.  If your understanding of these concepts is solid, you'll be much better off in a high-stress situation!
