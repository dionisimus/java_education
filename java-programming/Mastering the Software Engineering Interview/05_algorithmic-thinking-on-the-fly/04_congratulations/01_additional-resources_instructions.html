  What to do now?
 </h1>
 <p>
  Congratulations!  Working through the material in this course helped you get well on your way towards mastering the software engineering interview.   As you've seen, many of the key interviewing skills and techniques are applicable in other contexts where technical communication and collaboration is important.  To help you keep working on these skills, we've put together additional resources.  As always, we invite you to keep the conversation going.  Have a favorite resource? Send it over to us in the Discussion Forums, and we may well add it to our list!

  Interview Resources
 </h2>
 <p>
  Examples, worked solutions, and tips: make sure you make the most use of them by working through the problems on your own first, ideally in situations that simulate as quickly as possible the interview setting.   Here is a collection of handouts from an MIT course (
  <a href="http://courses.csail.mit.edu/iap/interview/index.php">
   here
  </a>
  ) designed to prepare for Google interviews, but the examples and tips are broadly applicable.

  Discussion Forum
 </h2>
 <p>
  Even though this course is focussed on techniques for mastering the software engineering interview, those techniques are designed to highlight
  <strong>
   you
  </strong>
  and your suitability for the job you seek.  Each of you bring your experiences, strengths, and talents to the job.  Use the discussion forums to personalize your course experience by discussing issues that you care about: some of you may be recent or soon-to-be graduates and are looking for your first position; others could be switching careers after years (or decades) or work experience; yet others are rejoining the engineering work-force after a gap.  Ask questions and find others in your situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, once you've landed an interview, share your experiences on the discussion forum.  Title your post with "#Interview_CompanyName" and make your fellow learners very happy!

    "The interview will probably in a conference room with old markers that barely work anymore. You don't want to get frustrated when the marker starts running out as you are writing some code on the white board. The interviewer will probably not know where to get new markers because they are in another part of the building they are not familiar with.  Since you are coding on a white board, the marker is your tool.
    <strong>
     Bringing your own markers
    </strong>
    to code will show that you are prepared. Also, using your own markers might make you more comfortable on the white board.One more thing. Get the skinny markers so you can write more on the white board."

    "Hi, everyone. Just found out about this resource two weeks ago:www.pramp.comI did 11 interviews already and I don't think I will ever stop. I believe this is the most efficient way to prepare yourself for a technical interview. I encourage everyone to try."

    "...I worked as a software engineer from 1994-2000, and then stopped working outside the home after I had children.The instructors say to cull anything from your resume that you can't
    <strong>
     talk about fluently
    </strong>
    . I recently dug out my resume, and am finding that while I can give a high level explanation of most of my old projects, I would struggle to recall the nitty gritty technical details of projects from 20 years ago. I hope people will be understanding about this!"
