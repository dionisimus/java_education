  Evaluation questions
 </h1>
 <p>
  We've worked through several examples of the 6-step process for solving technical problems in an interactive setting.  To prepare for the assignment this week, which will ask you to critique both the mock interviews we provide as well as your own interview which you will record, this reading summarizes the main questions that interviewers will ask themselves to evaluate your execution of the 6-step process.  We will ask you to apply some of these questions to the mock interviews and then to your own interview.

 <ol bullettype="numbers">
  <li>
   <p>
    How did the candidate
    <strong>
     analyze
    </strong>
    the problem?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Did the candidate miss any special or
    <strong>
     edge cases
    </strong>
    ?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Did the candidate approach the problem
    <strong>
     methodically
    </strong>
    and logically?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Did the candidate ask
    <strong>
     clarifying questions
    </strong>
    when they were stuck?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Does the candidate have a strong foundation in basic
    <strong>
     computer science concepts
    </strong>
    ?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Did the candidate produce
    <strong>
     working code
    </strong>
    ? Did the candidate
    <strong>
     test
    </strong>
    the code?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Is the candidate’s code clean and easy to read and
    <strong>
     maintain
    </strong>
    ?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Can the candidate
    <strong>
     explain
    </strong>
    their ideas
    <strong>
     clearly
    </strong>
    ?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Is the candidate
    <strong>
     pleasant
    </strong>
    to work with?
   </p>
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Remember, an interviewer is trying to understand how you approach and solve a problem. The answer doesn’t always need to be right.
