 <p>
  Good job for finishing this quiz. You have been listening to a lot of tips and now, we wanted to give you actual examples of resumes. Each of them represents a different point that you should pay attention to so that you can further improve your resume. But it is impossible for us to cover every single piece of information and thus we may have missed some. So if there is something that you learned or found helpful, then please share them on the Discussion Forum. Let's exchange what we know and become more prepared!

    Consider the following resume:
   </p>
  </li>
 </ol>
 <asset assettype="generic" extension="pdf" id="ZDRm_L44EeW5HxL1x7hutQ" name="Q1ResumeA">
 </asset>
 <p>
  Which of the following is the
  <em>
   main
  </em>
  flaw in this resume?
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     It is likely out of date
    </strong>
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  We will discuss this more in the video that follows this quiz, but notice that the applicant has a large gap between August 2014 and the present (January 2016). Given the activities of the applicant in previous summers, one would expect something similarly significant in the summer of 2015. However, even the applicant's honors seem to have stopped abruptly in 2014. Making this gap stand out even more, the applicant listed a position as the founder and president of the University Robotics Kite Club in Fall 2015, making the gap in spring and summer 2015 stand out even more.
 </p>
 <p>
  In contrast, consider Taylor Techie's resume, which is clearly more up to date:
 </p>
 <asset assettype="generic" extension="pdf" id="U6_4nr5fEeWdLBLKe7q0lw" name="Q1ResumeUpToDate">
 </asset>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  We understand that this gap may not seem so bad but rather natural, given the fact that he/she is a student. He/she may have had other summer activities and may not have partaken in any project. But unfortunately, the job market is growing more competitive and according to the Google recruiters, these gaps are not desirable. Therefore we suggest taking online courses, do opensource project, or do anything to keep learning and improving your skills. Be more active to strengthen your resume and show how committed you are.
 </p>
 <p>
  We also understand that some of you are not traditional college-age students and are balancing more life responsibilities, and thus may already have gaps due to different circumstances. In those cases, it is important to be honest about your gaps and explicitly state them in your resume rather than ignoring them. For example, if you were stay at home parent for few years, then you can say so in your resume (and, on a side note--good for you!  We think this is probably one of the hardest jobs out there!).  Many things happen in life. By being honest, recruiters and interviewers will not wonder why you have a gap and will become more understanding, and you may even find something to talk about with them that will ultimately lead to you getting the job because of the qualities and experiences that make you stand out.

  <li>
   <p>
    <em>
     Its formatting makes it hard to read
    </em>
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Its formatting could probably be improved slightly, but overall it is not hard to read.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    <em>
     It likely overstates the applicant's skills
    </em>
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  No, it actually very likely states them appropriately. Notice how the applicant has listed her or his different level of proficiency with different programming languages.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    <em>
     The experience listed is not appropriate for the position sought
    </em>
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  In fact, each position listed under experience is directly related to the position the applicant seeks, so this a well-targeted resume for the position sought.

  <strong>
   REQUIRED reflective question]
  </strong>
  This next question is a self-graded task. You'll need to complete a separate task before you can answer this question.
 </p>
 <p>
  Consider the following resume:
 </p>
 <asset assettype="generic" extension="pdf" id="UKuUKb5JEeWdLBLKe7q0lw" name="Q2ResumeTooLong">
 </asset>
 <p>
  This resume is obviously way too long. Your goal is to create a new resume with most of the same content but with different formatting so that all the information (1) fits on one page, and (2) is appropriately and clearly organized so that it's easy to pick out the skills and experience that this candidate has. You can reorganize content as you feel is appropriate, or cut any content you don't feel belongs on a 1-page resume.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you've completed this task, answer the following question:
 </p>
 <p>
  Were you able create a 1-page resume that clearly presents the same information about the candidate? We'll show you our version in the feedback so you can compare what you did to what we did. We also encourage you to post your version on the discussion forum (via link or image) to discuss your approach with your fellow learners!
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    If you shortened it to 1 page, then great job! If you couldn't, don't worry! Take a look at our version here and compare it to what you did. What do you like about yours compared to ours? What do you like about ours compared to yours?
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <asset assettype="generic" extension="pdf" id="Xxip0b5JEeWdfA6efk4-Nw" name="ResumeShortened">
 </asset>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  3. Consider this resume:
 </p>
 <asset assettype="generic" extension="pdf" id="s5VTEL5aEeW5HxL1x7hutQ" name="Q4AveryAble">
 </asset>
 <p>
  Which of the following scenarios is most likely to occur in Avery's interview?
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Avery will not be able to correctly implement the solution to the live coding question the interviewer asks.
    </strong>
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Right, this is the situation that is most likely to occur, given the skills listed on Avery's resume. It is unlikely that as a first-year CS student, Avery knows 15 languages well enough to code comfortably in them in an interview setting no matter how much self-study Avery has done. But because 15 languages are listed, that gives the interviewer fair game to select any for the live coding questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially early in your career, be honest with your skills. Distunguish between languages in which you are proficient, comfortable, and have only passing knowledge on, as Taylor Techie does in this resume:
 </p>
 <asset assettype="generic" extension="pdf" id="6de_ZL5bEeW6MQpkLEOUaQ" name="Q4TaylorTechie">
 </asset>
 <p>
  This way you don't "oversell" your skills and end up falling short during the interview. It is important to be honest.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    <em>
     Avery will not be able to correctly describe the experience of participating in a Hackathon
    </em>
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Avery has participated in a Hackathon only about 2 and a half years ago, so this experience is probably fresh enough for Avery to discuss competently.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    <em>
     The interviewer will speak in French, and Avery will not understand.
    </em>
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Given that Avery is a first-year student with only a minor in French, the interviewer is unlikely to speak to Avery in French, assuming the job does not require that candidates be fluent in French.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    <em>
     Avery will not be able to answer the interview's question about graph algorithms.
    </em>
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Since Avery is only a first-year student, and Avery's resume clearly lists relevant coursework, the interviewer is not very likely to select a question that requires advanced knowledge from a course that Avery clearly has not yet taken. And if the interviewer did select such a question, Avery should feel comfortable stating that s/he has not yet taken this course.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  4. [
  <strong>
   REQUIRED reflective question]
  </strong>
  Consider the following two resumes:
 </p>
 <asset assettype="generic" extension="pdf" id="LrFo675eEeWdLBLKe7q0lw" name="Q5TaylorTechie">
 </asset>
 <asset assettype="generic" extension="pdf" id="Po0pzL5eEeWdLBLKe7q0lw" name="Q5AveryAble">
 </asset>
 <p>
  For each applicant, state a brief description of the job you think they are applying for, and then give a sentence or two about why you think this.
 </p>
 <p>
  While you answer this question, consider what about their resumes makes answering this question easier or more difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    You probably found this much easier to do in the case of Avery Able. Avery is probably applying for an internship that involves taking data, potentially image or video data, from a networked system and then applying some kind of computer vision or machine learning algorithms. While Avery's resume doesn't list nearly as much detail as Taylor's, Avery's details are targeted toward what seems to be a specific job with desired qualifications.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  On the other hand, it was difficult or impossible to predict the kind of job that Taylor was applying for. Taylor's resume lists just about every skill and piece of knowledge possible, and doesn't show how s/he is specifically qualified for a particular job.
 </p>
 <p>
  Remember that employers are generally looking to fill a specific role with someone with a specific set of skills. The more generic your resume looks, the more difficult it is for them to envision you filling their specific need. To the extent possible, target your resume to match the specific skills and knowledge required for the position you are applying for.
