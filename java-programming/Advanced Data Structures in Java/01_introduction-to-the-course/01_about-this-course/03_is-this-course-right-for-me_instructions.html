 <h2 level="2">
  Is this course right for me?
 </h2>
 <p>
  This course is designated as Intermediate Level, with "some experience required." But you're probably wondering just what experience, exactly, is required. In this reading and the quiz that follows, we will try to help you determine whether or not you have the correct background for this course and this specialization.
 </p>
 <p>
  We assume that you have
  <strong>
   taken and passed a college-level introductory Object Oriented Java programming course designed for CS majors ("CS1") and completed at least part of an introductory data structures course ("CS2")
  </strong>
  , or their online equivalents. Topics in these courses typically include at least the following topics:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Variables and types
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Basic data types: Strings, ints, doubles, etc.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Loops (for, while, nested loops)
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Calling methods
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Writing methods (with and without return types, with and without parameters)
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Using objects and possibly designing them
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    1D and 2D arrays
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Basic input and output (System.out.println)
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Compiling and running Java code
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Creating and designing classes
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Variable Scope
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Inheritance and Polymorphism
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Abstract classes and Interfaces
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Searching and sorting arrays
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Running time analysis using big-O notation
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Arrays, Linked Lists and trees (including binary search trees): both use and implementation
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>

  One example of of a CS1 course is
  <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ricko/CSE11/Syllabus.html">
   UC San Diego's CSE 11.
  </a>
  The relevant CS2 course at UC San Diego is
  <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/eng.ucsd.edu/cse-12-spring-2015-a00-b00/home">
   CSE12
  </a>
  , which we would expect you to know at least some of the material for.  If the content in the course schedules on these pages looks familiar to you, you're in good shape. Here at Coursera, we've designed this course to be the third in our intermediate programming specialization, following our first two courses:  "
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java/">
   Object Oriented Programming in Java
  </a>
  " and "
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance">
   Data Structures: Measuring and Optimizing Performance
  </a>
  ". If you have some background in Java but are unfamiliar with some of the topics above (like Inheritance), we recommend you start at either the first or second course, whichever is more appropriate.  Each previous course has a similar "Is this course right for me?" guide to help you decide.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you are brand new to programming, you may want to start with the introductory Java specialization "
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming">
   Java Programming: An Introduction to Software
  </a>
  " offered by Duke University.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2">
  What if I have taken  "CS1" (introductory programming) and "CS2" (basic data structures) courses, but they weren't in Java?
 </h2>
 <p>
  If you have taken courses that cover all or most of the above topics, but it was in a language like C or C++, you will probably do fine in our specialization. We recommend that you review Java syntax and some details of how Java works with objects using some basic online resources (e.g.
  <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_basic_syntax.htm">
   http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_basic_syntax.htm
  </a>
  ). You may benefit from reviewing information in this specialization's first course: "
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java/">
   Object Oriented Programming in Java
  </a>
  "
 </p>
 <p>
  If your introductory courses were in a language like Scheme, Python or Javascript or another scripting language, you might still be OK, though it will be a bit more challenging because of the difference between Java and these languages. You might try this course, but keep an open mind to falling back to the
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming">
   Duke specialization
  </a>
  if you find you are in over your head.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2">
  Take the quiz for guidance...
 </h2>
 <p>
  Up next we've got a short quiz to help you figure out whether you're in the right place. Feel free to skip it if you know this course is for you, or even ignore its results if you like. It's just for your own information, and ultimately you should place yourself where you feel most comfortable and challenged.  After the quiz we have a reading that repeats some of these recommended resources if you feel that you're not quite ready to take this course.
