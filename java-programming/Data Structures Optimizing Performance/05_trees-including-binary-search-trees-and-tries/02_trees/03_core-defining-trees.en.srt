00:00:04,328 --> 00:00:07,875
Hi, in the last video we saw why we
value trees and why trees are so

3
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,720
common in computer science.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,250
In this video we are just going
to dive into some of the basics,

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,530
of saying what do we mean by a tree?

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,080
So, by the end of this video you should be
able to describe a tree data structure.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,980
So first off, let's talk terminology.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,590
So, I'm gonna use the example here,

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,310
of the family tree just like
we did in the last video.

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,643
And the reason I'm using a family tree is
that some of this terminology is related

11
00:00:31,643 --> 00:00:33,300
to how family trees work.

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,340
So if we're thinking of the relationship
between Tywin and Jamie,

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,420
we know that Tywin is the parent of Jamie.

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,340
I also wanna point out in this slide,

15
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,250
that you'll notice I didn't
keep all possible parents.

16
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,360
So there's only one parent
of each of these children,

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,790
to essentially keep it a cleaner tree.

18
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,580
Other terminology.

19
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,470
So, where do you start in the tree?

20
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,400
That's called the root node.

21
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,909
The root node is gonna be the only
node that doesn't have any parents.

22
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:07,060
Leaf nodes are any node
that has no children.

23
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,400
So there's a number of leaf nodes here,
Tyrion, Myrcella, Joffrey,

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,010
Tommen, and Jaime are all leaf nodes
because they have no children.

25
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,790
Now that we know the basic terminology,
what actually makes for a tree?

26
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,110
Well, you have a single root and
again, that is gonna have no parent.

27
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,857
Each node can have only one parent,
except for, again,

28
00:01:28,857 --> 00:01:31,606
that root node which is
allowed not to have one.

29
00:01:31,606 --> 00:01:33,980
And then there can be no cycles in a tree.

30
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,480
And all I mean by a cycle is
that there can't be a loop.

31
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,964
We'll see an example of
that in a little while.

32
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,561
All right, so now that we have
a basic definition of a tree,

33
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:46,508
which of these do we think are trees?

34
00:01:46,508 --> 00:01:49,761
Go ahead and answer this in the in-video
quiz, and we'll come back in just a bit.

35
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,335
Welcome back.

36
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:53,763
So, hopefully the in-video quiz helped.

37
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:57,131
Let's just walk through each
of these in more detail.

38
00:01:57,131 --> 00:01:59,830
So, is A a tree?

39
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,960
Absolutely.

40
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,970
You have a single root.

41
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,610
The root has no parent.

42
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,590
And that's okay.

43
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,473
And then each of the children
have exactly one parent.

44
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:09,340
And that's fine too.

45
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,940
What about B?

46
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,460
Is that a tree?

47
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,230
You've only got a parent and a child.

48
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,850
Is that enough to be a tree?

49
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,030
Yeah, it is.

50
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,160
Again, you've got one root, that's fine.

51
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,669
Each node has only one parent, and there's
no cycles here, so this is a tree as well.

52
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:28,503
Can you have just a single node?

53
00:02:28,503 --> 00:02:29,490
Is that sufficient?

54
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,750
Yeah, it is.

55
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,490
Again, I've got a single
root that has no parents.

56
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,180
There are no other nodes, so we don't
have to worry about the others, and

57
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:37,900
there is no cycle.

58
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,080
What about the last one here?

59
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,740
Is this a tree?

60
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,250
Well, no, it's not.

61
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,120
This has two things wrong with it.

62
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,640
The first is that the very bottom
node here has two parents, and

63
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,980
we said from the very beginning every
node has to have one parent except for

64
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,770
the root who can have none.

65
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,220
The other thing that's wrong with
this is this is a perfect example of

66
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,100
a cycle, right?

67
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,400
If I start at the very top, and
I go to the left and then I go down,

68
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,770
well I get to the same node that I
could have gotten to the other way.

69
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,749
And that's the cycle.

70
00:03:10,952 --> 00:03:12,820
What about this last one?

71
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,360
Is this a tree.

72
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,430
No, it's not either.

73
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,460
The reason why is because I have
two nodes that have no parents.

74
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,680
Which means I have two nodes
which are root nodes and

75
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,560
that's not permitted either.

76
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,137
So now that we have a better feel for
what makes for a tree,

77
00:03:27,137 --> 00:03:30,377
in the next video, we'll start talking
about how to code them in Java.
