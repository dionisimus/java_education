2
00:00:03,553 --> 00:00:05,028
So when I was learning about trees,

3
00:00:05,028 --> 00:00:07,850
I learned about the different
kind of tree traversals.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,700
Level order, in order,
pre order, post order.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,550
And you know,
I dutifully did the work, but

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,240
I never quite understood
what they were good for.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,000
And so many,

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,430
many years later, well after the class I
had taken on trees, I was doing my thesis.

9
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,570
And at some point in that thesis
development, I realized suddenly,

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,160
this is a pattern recognition problem,
it's a problem in artificial intelligence.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,340
That I was actually
working with a tree again.

12
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,640
And I was thinking about how to solve,
this one problem, that I had to solve for

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,770
my thesis.

14
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,940
And suddenly it hit me.

15
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,710
Oh my gosh,
I need a level order traversal here.

16
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,900
And it was of those moments, where I'm
like, oh, all that stuff I used back then.

17
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,320
It does have a point.

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,670
It is useful.

19
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,060
And it really kind of hit
the point home for me.
