Hi.

3
00:00:07,754 --> 00:00:11,754
So, one of the products I work on is the
Google Takeout product within My Account.

4
00:00:11,754 --> 00:00:17,360
And one of the things we like to use trees
for is to represent file structures.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,460
So, they're ideal for
representing hierarchies in a system.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,879
And we'd like to model them,
perhaps group them, shuffle them around.

7
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:29,647
We also pass those structures around to
different parts of the system, so we can

8
00:00:29,647 --> 00:00:33,710
manipulate them, add to them, can search
them, and trees make a great fit for that.
