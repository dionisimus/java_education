[MUSIC] Hi. So, one of the products I work on is the
Google Takeout product within My Account. And one of the things we like to use trees
for is to represent file structures. So, they're ideal for
representing hierarchies in a system. And we'd like to model them,
perhaps group them, shuffle them around. We also pass those structures around to
different parts of the system, so we can manipulate them, add to them, can search
them, and trees make a great fit for that.
