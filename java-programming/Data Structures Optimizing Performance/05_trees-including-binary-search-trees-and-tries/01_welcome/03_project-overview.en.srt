00:00:04,266 --> 00:00:06,850
Welcome to the module four project.

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,740
This project is gonna be a lot of fun
because you're going to get to enable

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,310
this Spelling Suggestions,
not suggestions yet, but

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,710
at least the ability to flag incorrectly
spelled words, and most excitingly,

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,770
this AutoComplete functionality.

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,140
So, you're gonna be adding some
spelling help into your application.

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,830
So, let me just give you a demo
of what this is gonna look like.

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,046
So, if I turn on Spelling Suggestions,

10
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:36,679
what you'll see when you type,
is that as I type, Hello,

11
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:41,809
as long as the words are typed correctly,
there's no problem.

12
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:46,774
But if I type something like sentenc,
like that and I forget the e,

13
00:00:46,774 --> 00:00:51,910
you can see that this word is
going to be flagged as misspelled.

14
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,070
Now, in the next week,

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,841
next week you'll be able to add the
ability to right-click on this word, and

16
00:00:56,841 --> 00:01:00,043
get some spelling suggestions of
what I might have meant to type.

17
00:01:00,043 --> 00:01:02,890
But that's not going to be
implemented until next week.

18
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,690
So for now, you'll just see that
it's flagged as a misspelled word.

19
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,467
But even more excitingly, what you're
going to get to do is, you're going to get

20
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:14,700
to turn on this AutoComplete functionality
and have it actually work correctly.

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,760
So, now when I start to type,
you can see that I can have all

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,000
of the possibilities of what I might
be trying to type displaying for me.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,710
Or at least it just displays
six right now, so I can choose,

24
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,111
like maybe I meant to say sentence,
oh, look I did.

25
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:33,619
So, I can just choose that and
then go on, sentence this, and

26
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:37,802
you can see that sometimes it doesn't
come up with what I'm looking for,

27
00:01:37,802 --> 00:01:40,449
cuz it's only showing
me six possibilities.

28
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,303
But it then almost always does,
once I type a little bit more.

29
00:01:45,303 --> 00:01:48,926
So, this is really fun piece of the
project, and I hope you're looking forward

30
00:01:48,926 --> 00:01:52,510
to learning everything you need to know,
in order to add this functionality.
