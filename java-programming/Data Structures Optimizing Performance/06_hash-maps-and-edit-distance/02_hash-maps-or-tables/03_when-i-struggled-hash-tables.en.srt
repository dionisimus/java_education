Hi, my name is Maya.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,380
And I took a class about data structures.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,750
And for
most of the class I was doing well.

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,650
I was understanding everything.

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,700
But then we got to hash tables,
and for some reason it was just so

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,500
confusing, and
I didn't know what I was gonna do.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,890
So, I decided to go to my study group.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,910
And my friends were talking through it.

10
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,540
They were like, okay, I was understanding.

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,290
But then, when I went back home
to work on it, I was lost again.

12
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,550
I was like,
is it my algorithm that's not right?

13
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,120
Is it maybe I don't understand
what hash table should do?

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,870
I wasn't sure.

15
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,290
So I was like, okay.

16
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,280
I started early so I can just take
a break and I'll come back to it.

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,910
So I decided to go to sleep and
it was really funny, because while I was

18
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,195
sleeping, I remember just waking up and
was like wait, I know how to do this.

19
00:00:52,195 --> 00:00:57,280
So I just got down from my bunk bed,
went to my desk, wrote some notes.

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,921
Went back to sleep, and
when I woke up I found out that it was,

21
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:03,834
maybe, taking a break.

22
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:08,546
Or maybe because I just got to move
away from the material for a little bit,

23
00:01:08,546 --> 00:01:11,820
it kind of got to soak in and
I understood it better.

24
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,880
And that's my story on hash tables.
