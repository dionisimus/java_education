[MUSIC] Hi, my name is Maya. And I took a class about data structures. And for
most of the class I was doing well. I was understanding everything. But then we got to hash tables,
and for some reason it was just so confusing, and
I didn't know what I was gonna do. So, I decided to go to my study group. And my friends were talking through it. They were like, okay, I was understanding. But then, when I went back home
to work on it, I was lost again. I was like,
is it my algorithm that's not right? Is it maybe I don't understand
what hash table should do? I wasn't sure. So I was like, okay. I started early so I can just take
a break and I'll come back to it. So I decided to go to sleep and
it was really funny, because while I was sleeping, I remember just waking up and
was like wait, I know how to do this. So I just got down from my bunk bed,
went to my desk, wrote some notes. Went back to sleep, and
when I woke up I found out that it was, maybe, taking a break. Or maybe because I just got to move
away from the material for a little bit, it kind of got to soak in and
I understood it better. And that's my story on hash tables.
