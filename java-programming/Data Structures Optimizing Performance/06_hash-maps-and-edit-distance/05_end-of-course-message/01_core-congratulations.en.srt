00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,971
Congratulations, you worked
through a difficult project and

3
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:07,578
hope you're proud of what you achieved.

4
00:00:07,578 --> 00:00:11,591
>> Think back on all the code that you've
written, the theory that you've learned,

5
00:00:11,591 --> 00:00:15,661
the data structures that you've analyzed
and even if it doesn't feel that way right

6
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:18,813
now, this material is really at
the heart of computer science and

7
00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:22,023
will serve you well throughout
your career, and especially if and

8
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:25,634
when you choose to apply for a new job
that uses some software engineering,

9
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:27,350
this stuff will be really useful.

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,030
>> So,
we've had a lot of fun in this course.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,670
And we hope you have, too.

12
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,540
And we hope that you'll also join us for
our next course in a specialization.

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,360
In that next course,

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,850
we're going to be looking at a new
data structure called a graph.

15
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,755
We'll also be looking at some
more advanced algorithms for

16
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:44,332
working with data in the graph.

17
00:00:44,332 --> 00:00:45,600
So, we hope to see you there.
