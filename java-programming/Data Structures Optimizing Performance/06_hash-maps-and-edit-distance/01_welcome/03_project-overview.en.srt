2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:08,256
In this video we're gonna look at the cool
features you'll get to ad to your

3
00:00:08,256 --> 00:00:10,220
text editor as part of week 5.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,510
So the first of these is
essentially spelling suggestions,

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,960
which is a core feature
of any text editor today.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,365
So once you turn on spelling suggestions,

7
00:00:17,365 --> 00:00:18,780
it's gonna mark the ones
that are incorrect,

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,330
which we've essentially
already figured out how to do.

9
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,240
Is we just check to see if
the words are in the dictionary.

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,250
But what spelling suggestions is gonna do,
is it's gonna allow you to right click on

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,280
a word, and have it give you suggestions
which are essentially words that are real

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,280
words that are close to
the misspelled word.

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,030
For example if I click on my
words key instead of working,

14
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,750
it's gonna give me working,
along with some other words that

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,120
are essentially very close
to that misspelled word.

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,090
I can select working to fix it, likewise,
for prooblems, I can click on that and

17
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,720
correct it to be problems.

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,080
Again, this is a core
featuring text generator.

19
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,860
It's a fun feature to implement, and
that's the first part of the assignment.

20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,810
So the second part here is really just for
fun.

21
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,240
And in the second part what we're going
to do is essentially play a game where

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,720
we try to go from one word to another by
making small interchanges that result

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,950
in real words.

24
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,890
And I think this will more
clear with an example.

25
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,400
So let me input the word this and time.

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,880
And what we're going to
do is try to find a path

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,600
by making these small
changes from this to time.

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,040
And the path that it
finds takes four steps.

29
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,940
So if I start with the word this and
I try to make permutations to it,

30
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,050
I could add a letter
like n to produce thins.

31
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:37,350
Once I have thins, I can change
the letter S to E to make it thine.

32
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,760
Once I have thine, I can remove
the letter H to produce the word tine.

33
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,820
And once I have the word tine, I can
change the letter n to be the letter M.

34
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,940
Notice for each of these steps,

35
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,830
I'm making a single character
mutation that results in a real word.

36
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,270
This is kind of a fun game
to play in your head, but

37
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,840
in this case we're gonna
be implementing it in code.

38
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,200
So again, hope you have fun
with this project, good luck!
