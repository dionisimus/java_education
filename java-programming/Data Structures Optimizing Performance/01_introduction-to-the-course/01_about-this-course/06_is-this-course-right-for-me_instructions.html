  First, a quick note, sometimes we refer to the "
  <strong>
   first course in the specialization
  </strong>
  ."  When we do so, we are referring to the
  <strong>
   Object Oriented Programming in Java
  </strong>
  course you likely just finished.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, if you completed our course "
  <strong>
   Object-Oriented Programming in Java
  </strong>
  " you're definitely in the right place.  Feel free to skip this reading and the following quiz.

 <h2 level="2">
  Is this course right for me?
 </h2>
 <p>
  This course is designated as Intermediate Level, with "some experience required." But you're probably wondering just what experience, exactly, is required. In this reading and the quiz that follows, we will try to help you determine whether or not you have the correct background for this course and this specialization.
 </p>
 <p>
  We assume that you have
  <strong>
   taken and passed a college-level introductory Object Oriented Java programming course designed for CS majors
  </strong>
  , or its online equivalent. Topics in these courses typically include at least the following topics:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Variables and types
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Basic data types: Strings, ints, doubles, etc.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Loops (for, while, nested loops)
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Calling methods
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Writing methods (with and without return types, with and without parameters)
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Using objects and possibly designing them
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    1D and 2D arrays
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Basic input and output (System.out.println)
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Compiling and running Java code
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Creating and designing classes
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Variable Scope
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Inheritance and Polymorphism
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Abstract classes and Interfaces
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Searching arrays
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>

  One example of such a course is

   UC San Diego's CSE 11.
  </a>
  If the content in the course schedule (bottom of that page) looks familiar to you, you're in good shape. Here at Coursera, we've designed this course to follow the course: "
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java/">
   Object Oriented Programming in Java
  </a>
  ". If you have some background in Java but are unfamiliar with some of the topics above (like Inheritance), we recommend you start with that course.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you are brand new to programming, you may want to start with the introductory Java specialization "
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming">
   Java Programming: An Introduction to Software
  </a>
  " offered by Duke University.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2">
  What if I have taken an object oriented introductory programming course, but it wasn't in Java?
 </h2>
 <p>
  If you have taken a course that covers all or most of the above topics, but it was in a language like C, C++, or python, you will probably do fine in our specialization. We recommend that you review Java syntax and some details of how Java works with objects using some basic online resources (e.g.
  <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_basic_syntax.htm">
   http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_basic_syntax.htm
  </a>
  ).  You may benefit from reviewing information in our prior course:  "
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java/">
   Object Oriented Programming in Java
  </a>
  "
 </p>
 <p>
  If your introductory course was in a language like Scheme, Javascript, or another scripting language, you might still be OK, though it will be a bit more challenging because of the difference between Java and these languages. You might try this course, but keep an open mind to falling back to the
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming">
   Duke specialization
  </a>
  if you find you are in over your head.

  Take the quiz for guidance...

 <p>
  Up next we've got a short quiz to help you figure out whether you're in the right place. Feel free to skip it if you know this course is for you, or even ignore its results if you like. It's just for your own information, and ultimately you should place yourself where you feel most comfortable and challenged.  After the quiz we repeat some of the resources listed above if you want a little more practice before you start this course.
