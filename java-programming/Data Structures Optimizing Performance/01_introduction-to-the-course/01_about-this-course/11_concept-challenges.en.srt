00:00:03,665 --> 00:00:08,180
Hi again, I'm Leo Porter, I'm a Computer
Science professor here at UC San Diego.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,380
One of my areas of research is
Computer Science Education.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,550
What we like to do in that area of
research is look at the best practices for

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,560
student learning in the classroom.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,200
One of the best practices we know about
in computer science is Peer Instruction.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,210
With peer instruction,

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,180
students get to tackle hard problems,
discuss it with their peers, and

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,020
then participate in a large class
wide discussion with the professor.

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,430
We do this in a number of
the courses here at UC San Diego,

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,760
and we like to bring this to you.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,729
And we're gonna do this through a series
of videos known as the Concept Challenges.

13
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,030
So, let me walk through an example here.

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,410
So, here we have you watching a video.

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,360
Now, let's assume this is from a previous
class in Java that you've taken before,

16
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,350
where you learned first about for loops.

17
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,640
So, you watch the video on for loops and
then you get done with the video and

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,620
the question becomes,
well, did you learn it?

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,030
I mean there's certainly areas of the
video that you probably understood well,

20
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,620
but there may be some areas that
you didn't understand as well.

21
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,704
So the best way to find out whether or
not you really understood the material,

22
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:09,610
is to solve problems.

23
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:15,143
So we're gonna ask you questions to help
illustrate what areas you're strongest in,

24
00:01:15,143 --> 00:01:17,051
and which areas you're not.

25
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:19,610
So, a question may look
something like this.

26
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,350
So here you've just watched
the video again on for loops.

27
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,570
And here is an example of for loop.

28
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:29,140
And the question here is asking, how many
times does i less than 10 execute?

29
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,270
Now, the reason we ask a question
like this is because we expect

30
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,740
a number of folks will get this wrong.

31
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,132
In fact, we want you to get
a number of these questions wrong,

32
00:01:36,132 --> 00:01:38,300
because that means it's an opportunity for
learning.

33
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,257
What we expected is a lot of novice
learners would answer B here.

34
00:01:42,257 --> 00:01:47,170
They would say that the loop executes ten times,
so i is less than 10 will execute ten times.

35
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,050
But the condition i less than 10
actually executes 11 times.

36
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,490
And we'll talk more about
that as we go forward.

37
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,860
So after you solve the problem on your
own, after you tackle the problem yourself

38
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,200
which we will then see, or we hope you can
do is work with other learners around you.

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,305
So if you have anyone else in your
neighborhood or friends who are taking

40
00:02:07,305 --> 00:02:10,684
the same course this is a great time to
get together and discuss the question.

41
00:02:10,684 --> 00:02:14,524
And by discussing with your friends your
gonna find out one of you might say wait

42
00:02:14,524 --> 00:02:18,248
a second, does it execute that last
time and then you realize oh shoot yeah,

43
00:02:18,248 --> 00:02:20,133
it does actually execute 11 times.

44
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:22,831
But if you don't have
some friends around you,

45
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:26,811
what we're gonna give you also
a series of videos where you're seeing

46
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:30,120
UC San Diego learners
discussing the question.

47
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,900
And there you'll hear them say things
like, wait a second it's really easy to

48
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,439
forget that last check, oh yeah,
so the answer must have been 11.

49
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,260
And then after you hear
the UC San Diego learner discussing it,

50
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,260
you're gonna hear one of our explanations.

51
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,540
So the full course of one of
these questions is gonna look

52
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,780
something like this.

53
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,740
You're gonna pause,
try solving the problem yourself.

54
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,280
You're gonna discuss the question with
other learners around you if you can.

55
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,030
You're then gonna watch a video of
the UC San Diego learners discussing it.

56
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,740
And then you're gonna

57
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,080
confirm your understanding by
listening to our explanation.

58
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,570
By solving these kind of hard problems,

59
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,760
you're gonna understand
your material much better.

60
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,660
You're also gonna identify areas
that you might need improvement.

61
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,690
And that's where more support videos and
the forums come in.
