<b>Academic Integrity:</b><br>
<UL>
Integrity of scholarship is essential for an academic community. The University expects that both faculty and students will honor this principle and in so doing protect the validity of University intellectual work. For students, this means that all academic work will be done by the individual to whom it is assigned, without unauthorized aid of any kind. Review <a href="http://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Appendices/2">UCSD Policy on Integrity</a>.
<br>
<br>
Because it is essential, every student must print out, read, sign, and turn in the <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ricko/CSE11/How_to_Excel_with_Integrity_in_CSE_11.pdf">How to Excel with Integrity in CSE 11</a>.
And on each assignment/quiz/exam, students will affirm this agreement by writing: "<b>I Excel with Integrity</b>" pledge and sign their name.
<br>
<br>
Every student must also complete the <a href="http://aitutorial.ucsd.edu/">Academic Integrity Tutorial</a> before the end of Week 1.
All incoming students must complete this tutorial anyway otherwise they will not be able to enroll in classes for Winter quarter.
<br>
<br>
<!-- COMMENT
Instructions about a pre-class survey will be emailed to each students with a unique link. You are expected to complete your pre-class survey before the end of Week 1.
     END COMMENT -->
Likewise, every student must also complete the <a
href="http://libraries.ucsd.edu/assets/elearning/cse/cseplagiarismlink/story.html">
CSE Plagiarism Tutorial</a> before the end of Week 1.
Any student who does not complete these tutorials will automatically receive a 0 score for all quizzes/exams/assignments!
