a software engineer on the Google privacy
team in the Google office in Chicago.

4
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:19,072
I world on products that help keep
our users' data safe and secure.

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,720
I'm Aaron Sure, and

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,110
I'm a software engineer working on
shopping at Google's Pittsburgh office.

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:26,780
>> Hi, I'm Kelly.

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,490
>> Hi, I'm Quti.

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,360
>> And we're software engineers at
Google on the Google Docs team.

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,195
>> Hi
>> I'm Matt Healey.

11
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:36,125
I'm a Google engineer working on
conversational shopping in our

12
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,855
Pittsburgh office.

13
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:39,715
>> Hi there.
My name is John Taylor, and

14
00:00:39,715 --> 00:00:42,335
I'm an engineer in
Google's Pittsburgh office.

15
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:45,385
I'd like to welcome you to
Intermediate Programming.

16
00:00:45,385 --> 00:00:47,755
Now, I find programming a lot of fun.

17
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:50,565
Not only can you do some
extremely useful things with it,

18
00:00:50,565 --> 00:00:55,035
the act of programming itself can
be very satisfying and creative.

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,620
For any particular problem there
are lots of different ways you

20
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,760
could write a program to solve it.

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,990
But a good program has
a certain beauty and

22
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:09,580
elegance about it and an elegant program
is easy for other people to understand and

23
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:15,080
it's also easy for you to extend and
adapt later as requirements change.

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,140
And this course will help you write
beautiful and elegant programs.
