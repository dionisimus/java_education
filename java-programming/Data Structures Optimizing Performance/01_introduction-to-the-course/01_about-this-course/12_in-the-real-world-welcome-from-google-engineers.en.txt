My name is John Taylor, and I'm an engineer in
Google's Pittsburgh office. I'd like to welcome you to
Intermediate Programming. Now, I find programming a lot of fun. Not only can you do some
extremely useful things with it, the act of programming itself can
be very satisfying and creative. For any particular problem there
are lots of different ways you could write a program to solve it. But a good program has
a certain beauty and elegance about it and an elegant program
is easy for other people to understand and it's also easy for you to extend and
adapt later as requirements change. And this course will help you write
beautiful and elegant programs.
