  Course 2 Project Overview
 </h1>
 <p>
  Computers can do amazing things with text these days.  Spelling errors are practically a thing of the past, you barely type three characters and the computer seems to read your mind, knowing just what you are trying to type, and your computer can produce intelligible “speech”.  How do all these technologies work?  You’ll find out in this course, and in this project.
 </p>
 <p>
  The project for this course is to build a smart text editor/processor that incorporates “intelligent” behaviors of modern-day text interfaces including autocomplete, flagging misspelled words and spelling auto-correct.  In each module you’ll add a bit more functionality to your editor through the project associated with that module.
 </p>
 <p>
  The code you’ll be developing here is what’s called “back-end” code, in that you’ll be working with the text, and not directly with any user interface components.  This is so that you can really dig in and experiment with the different data structures you are learning and the running times for each of them.  However, we provide you with a snazzy user interface (aka “front-end”)  so that you can see the application of all of the functionality you implement.  This division of behavior (front-end vs. back-end) is typical in intermediate and large-scale software design.   However, if you feel inspired, you’re always welcome to play with the front-end code as well.  Although we will not explicitly cover it in this course, we encourage you to seek external resources and play around if you are interested.
