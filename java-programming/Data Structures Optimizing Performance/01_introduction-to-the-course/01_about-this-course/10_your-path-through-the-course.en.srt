2
00:00:03,907 --> 00:00:04,710
Hi again.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:05,880
I’m Christine Alvarado.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,900
And in this video, I’m going to give you
some information that will help you choose

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,500
your own path through this course.

6
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,630
So when I’m not teaching, what I like
to do is I like to build programs and

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,220
curriculum that help bring in
a diverse set of learners to study and

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,600
work in the field of computer science.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,320
And one thing I've learned about
reaching a diverse audience

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,490
is that you need diverse courses
with diverse support structures.

11
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,590
So we've engineered this
diversity into our course and

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,765
into the whole specialization.

13
00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:40,598
We know that you're coming to us with lots
of different motivations, backgrounds,

14
00:00:40,598 --> 00:00:41,975
experience levels.

15
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:45,765
So one size fits all is not
going to work for this course.

16
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:47,825
And that's okay, that's actually great.

17
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:50,675
We love that you're coming from
all these different backgrounds.

18
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,421
And what we want is for
each of you to feel challenged,

19
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:55,442
because otherwise what's the point.

20
00:00:55,442 --> 00:00:57,700
But, also never to feel overwhelmed.

21
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,880
We wanted it to be the case that when
you feel like your starting to get

22
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,300
overwhelmed, you can always have some more
support to help you with your learning.

23
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,050
What we've designed is a course where
we have different video styles,

24
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,930
different video series,
to help meet that goal.

25
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,980
So you're not going to want to take
this course by just sitting down and

26
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,400
watching the videos one after another.

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,970
What you're going to do is pick and

28
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,900
choose a path through the videos
that's right for you.

29
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,540
And to help you do that, I'm gonna tell
you about our different video series.

30
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,110
But first I wanna say that at the end of
the day, it's all about what you can do.

31
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,960
Mia described this really cool project
that you're going to be doing throughout

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,780
this course, and that's really
what we want you to be able to do.

33
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,260
So, what we care most about are these
end of module assessments, which are,

34
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,150
a lot of the time, going to have you
building a piece of that project.

35
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,150
So, if you're feeling really advanced, and

36
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,640
really good about the material,
always feel free to race ahead and

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,240
just start working on that project or
do the end of module assessment.

38
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,480
But if you want a little instruction,

39
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,690
which most of you will,
you'll wanna watch some of the videos.

40
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,630
So the first video series that I'm gonna
tell you about is our Core Content series.

41
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,650
So these are the videos that
we expect everybody to watch.

42
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,110
They’re mostly lecture style and
they're going to introduce you to the core

43
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,930
concepts and skills that you will need
to do the end of module assessments.

44
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,680
Once you've watched those videos, we're
going to probe your knowledge a little

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,190
bit more with our
Concept Challenge series.

46
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,180
Again we encourage most learners
to watch these videos, and

47
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,100
what they're going to do is they're
gonna ask you to think about

48
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,720
the material you just
learned in a new way.

49
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,720
And Leo's gonna tell you more about these
concept challenges in just a minute.

50
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,200
The next series that we have for
you are Additional Support videos.

51
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,030
Now we don't expect everybody
to watch these videos.

52
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,320
These videos are designed for,
if after watching the core content and

53
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,640
doing those concept challenges,

54
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,640
you don't quite feel ready to tackle
the end of module assessments.

55
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,280
You might want to watch these
additional support videos.

56
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,120
The last two video series that we have,
we're really excited about.

57
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,440
These are series that aren't
designed to deliver content so

58
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,790
much as to put the content that
you're learning in context.

59
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,760
So the first of these series
is called In the real world.

60
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,640
And we've got a team of real-life
Google engineers talking about why

61
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,630
what you're learning is important
in their work at Google and

62
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,010
in general in the software industry.

63
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,100
So that'll be a really good opportunity
for you to learn not only why what you're

64
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,880
learning is important but how it's
important to these individual engineers.

65
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,160
And then the last series that we have for
you is called When I struggled.

66
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,650
And what you're gonna see in this
series is a number of UC San Diego

67
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,600
learners as well as us talking
about our own experience

68
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,440
learning the material that you're
going to be learning in this course.

69
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,010
We'll talk about a time when we struggled
with the material that we're presenting.

70
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,790
And then we'll talk about how
we overcame these struggles.

71
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,430
So we hope you'll watch
both of those series and

72
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,109
that it will enrich
experience in this course.

73
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,900
So again, to summarize, the standard
path we imagined learner taking through

74
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,940
this course is that you would watch
this introduction with the Google

75
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,360
engineers talking about why these
concepts are important in the real world.

76
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,150
You would go through and

77
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,980
watch the core concept videos and
perform these concept challenges.

78
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,350
Maybe watching some videos about when some
learners struggled with these concepts

79
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,540
along the way.

80
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,760
And then perform the module level
assessment and you would repeat that for

81
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,800
each module.

82
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,400
But if you're feeling more advanced,
you might just want to race right through

83
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,120
those core concept videos and get to
that end of module assessment faster and

84
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,640
get developing on those projects.

85
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,980
And we encourage you to do that
if you're feeling comfortable.

86
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,910
And again, if you feel like you
need a little more support,

87
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,470
you've got those support
videos available to you.

88
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,840
So any time you feel like you don't
quite understand what's going on,

89
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,640
you need a little more help, go ahead and
pull out those support videos, and

90
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,490
we hope that you'll find
the support that you'll need.

91
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,750
So choose the path that's right for
you, challenge yourself and have fun.
