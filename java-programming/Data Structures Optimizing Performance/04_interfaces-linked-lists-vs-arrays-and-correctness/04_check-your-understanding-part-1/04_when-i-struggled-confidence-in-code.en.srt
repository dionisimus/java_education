Hi, my name is Robert.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,620
And I remember this one time when I
was in a data structures class and

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,526
we had a programming assignment to
write our compression algorithms,

5
00:00:14,526 --> 00:00:16,470
it was Huffman compression.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,648
And we were all getting into it.

7
00:00:18,648 --> 00:00:21,070
And I think because we'd done so
well on our previous assignments,

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:26,650
we wrote all of our code in a big rush
all together, no unit testing at all.

9
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,050
And when it all came together, we put in
the test cases, and it was all wrong.

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,350
We tried moving around
the different test cases, and

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,900
we couldn't see any pattern
about why everything was wrong.

12
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,360
We had reached that point
without any testing and we had

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,450
no confidence whatsoever that anything
we had written was actually correct.

14
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,040
So we had to completely tear down
our assignment from the bottom up,

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,840
and write tests, and actually get
confidence in each of our levels.

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,100
And now, since I've been coding for a
little bit longer, it seems kind of insane

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,470
not to write testing, but I definitely
didn't know that in the beginning,

18
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,880
and that caused me to struggle a lot.
