00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:08,464
When I first started computer science,
I was cruising the first few months

3
00:00:08,464 --> 00:00:12,167
because the practice that I did
was just taking a function and

4
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:14,220
just giving it what it needed.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,960
Just giving it the right
answer straight on.

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,540
And I didn't think too much
about the data structure.

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,470
I didn't know anything about
data structures back then.

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:28,320
And then I got into data structures,
and that was when my whole happy CS

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,840
world turned upside down and
I was struggling with it.

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,550
I pulled so many all-nighters
trying to finish projects that

11
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,430
just involved data structures,
just randomly implementing them.

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,950
And I was really frustrated, and

13
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,350
really wondering if CS was
something I would like to continue.

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,171
Or if that was my route, or
if I was even fit for it.

15
00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:54,401
But, then I got involved
into this project that

16
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:57,568
needed to implement Dijkstra's algorithm.

17
00:00:57,568 --> 00:01:04,350
And it was to determine the shortest
path from one place to another.

18
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,500
And then, that's when I realized,

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,090
that data structures are like
paintbrushes and paint.

20
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,130
And, your computer is like the canvas.

21
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,910
And with those data structures,
you can create masterpieces.

22
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,710
And the moral of the story
is that in computer science,

23
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:28,100
if you come across anything really
difficult or really hard, in the end,

24
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,010
they're usually the things that help you
the most, they're usually the things that

25
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,330
help you understand the beauty
behind computer science.
