00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:10,126
So one philosophy that people use and
actually apply testing to their projects,

3
00:00:10,126 --> 00:00:11,960
is called test driven development.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,790
And the purpose of test driven
development is to actually

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,400
make sure that you
are testing the right thing.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,420
A lot of times people will write
the code that they mean to, and

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,000
then they'll write the test, and
when the tests pass, they're happy and

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,060
they think they did the right thing.

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,613
But there's always the chance that the
test actually would have passed before you

10
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:31,390
made your changes, which means
you're not testing the right thing.

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,550
>> Yeah, so you wanna make sure
that you first write a test for

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,870
the soft piece of code
that you're writing.

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,730
So, first you write the test,
make sure that it fails, and

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,820
then go through and write your code.

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,340

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,390
>> It's a good principle to follow,

17
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,050
because that way you make sure that
you're never actually fixing a totally

18
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:51,900
different bug.

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,499
>> Exactly
