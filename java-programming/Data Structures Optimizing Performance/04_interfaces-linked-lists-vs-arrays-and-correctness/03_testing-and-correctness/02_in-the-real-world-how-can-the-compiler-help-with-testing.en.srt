00:00:06,254 --> 00:00:09,240
So the very first step is
actually the compiler.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,080
And not all languages are compiled,
but those that are will give you that

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,230
little extra assurance that your
code is syntactically correct.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:20,000
So like, are you calling methods
with the right kinds of arguments?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,810
Do you have any typos in your code?

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,950
Things like that.

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,440
It's not gonna tell you that your code is
like, behaving properly, but it will tell

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,555
you that it's building properly and you've
crossed all your Ts and dotted your eyes.
