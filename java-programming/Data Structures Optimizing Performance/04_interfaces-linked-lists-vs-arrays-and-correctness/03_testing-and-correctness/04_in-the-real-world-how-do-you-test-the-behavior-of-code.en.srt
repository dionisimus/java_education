00:00:06,208 --> 00:00:10,527
Then the other important bit about
testing your code is actually testing

3
00:00:10,527 --> 00:00:11,740
the behavior.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,380
So there are different ways
that you can test the behavior.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,400
One of them is unit testing.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,290
So with unit testing you basically just
want to test a particular piece of code.

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,990
So you want to make sure that you are only
testing an isolated piece of method,

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,870
rather than testing the whole software.

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,940
>> And then once you're pretty sure that
that little piece of code is working

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,290
properly, you can use
integration tests which will

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,660
check the connection between that piece
of code and other pieces of code.

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,880
So if you're writing a service that say,
like relies on a database,

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,350
you can actually check the connection
between your code and the database.

14
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,400
Make sure it's pulling information out of
it properly, storing stuff in it properly,

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,070
that kind of thing.
