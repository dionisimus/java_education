2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:08,058
So I remember the first few times that
I learned about regular expressions,

3
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:10,170
I was thoroughly confused.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,970
And this happened quite often, actually,

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,200
because my research area turns out to be
something that uses regular expressions,

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,870
and thinks about regular
expressions all the time.

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:24,650
And so I would go into these pretty
advanced seeming seminars, and right from

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,460
the get go, I was going back to basics and
saying, what does this mean again?

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,970
What are all these symbols?

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,330
And I felt kind of embarrassed that I
wasn't able to get it right away, and

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,340
it seemed like everyone else around
just sort of knew the lingo, but

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:43,280
then I realized that it's okay not to
have sort of internalized everything.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,050
And that I just needed to
cut myself some slack.

14
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,390
And go back to thinking
about the definitions.

15
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,610
And think about what each
of the symbols meant.

16
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:56,060
Because what was really confusing for me
is distinguishing between the pattern and

17
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,290
how we denote the pattern, and then,
thinking about the strings that match it.

18
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,460
And so having these two different kinds
of strings that are being involved in

19
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,620
the regular expressions.

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,390
And really understanding
the different roles that they play.

21
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,200
So what really helped me is,

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,860
actually thinking about these regular
expressions in a few different ways.

23
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,310
One of the ways that you can
do that is using automata.

24
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,990
And that's something that if you
continue in computer science and

25
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,200
when you continue in computer science,
you can learn a lot more about.

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,200
But, the moral of the story is that
when you come across something that may

27
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,030
seem some kind of intimidating,
what I find really helpful is to,

28
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,410
first of all, try to take a deep
breath and cut yourself some slack.

29
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,660
But, then also,
try to think of the different ways to

30
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,540
understand the definition and
to think about the problem.

31
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,460
And sometimes,

32
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,970
one of those alternate perspective
will just click a little bit better.
