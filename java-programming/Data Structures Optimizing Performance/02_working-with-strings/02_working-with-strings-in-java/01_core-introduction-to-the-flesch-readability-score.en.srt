2
00:00:04,306 --> 00:00:07,398
All right, in this course,
the project you're gonna be developing is

3
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:09,842
that cool text editor
that you saw the demo of.

4
00:00:09,842 --> 00:00:12,860
We're gonna get started here in this
lesson talking about the first thing

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,650
you'll add to that text editor,

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,270
which is the ability to determine
the readability of a piece of text.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,350
So let's talk about what that means.

8
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:24,320
By the end of this video you'll be
able to use the Flesch Index Score

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,590
in order to measure
the readability of a piece of text

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,560
in order to incorporate
it into your project.

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,390
So let's try to take a look at
what we mean by text readability.

12
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,650
So let's take a look
at this piece of text.

13
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,850
This is a piece of text from
the US Tax Code document.

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,758
The document that describes how
the United States taxes its citizens.

15
00:00:43,758 --> 00:00:46,940
And this is largely understood to
be one of the most confusing and

16
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,570
hard to understand documents around.

17
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,200
So I pulled a piece of text from that
document and that piece of text says,

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,720
there is hereby imposed on the taxable
income of every individual other than

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,670
a surviving spouse as defined in section
2(a) or the head of a household as

20
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,640
defined in section 2(b) who is not
a married individual (as defined

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,150
in section 7703) a tax determined in
accordance with the following table.

22
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,769
And then there's a table that follows.

23
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:18,611
Now I don't know about you, but
that's pretty difficult to understand.

24
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:23,100
And in fact, that's one of the easier
passages from this document to understand.

25
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,595
The first section I tried to pull, I spent
20 minutes trying to understand it, and

26
00:01:26,595 --> 00:01:29,690
I couldn't understand it so
I had to get a simpler piece of text.

27
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,190
So this is one of the simpler
pieces of text from that document.

28
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,070
It's still pretty complicated.

29
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,128
So, I'm confused,
let's simplify this text a little bit.

30
00:01:39,128 --> 00:01:43,420
Here's my re-write of what
that piece of text just said.

31
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,240
Basically it says, if you're single,
you've never lost your spouse, and you're

32
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,670
not the head of a household, then you pay
taxes according to the following table.

33
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,770
And again the same table would follow.

34
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,930
Much easier to understand.

35
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,900
So we have these two pieces of text.

36
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,760
The piece on top is relatively
difficult to understand,

37
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,790
the piece on the bottom is
relatively easy to understand.

38
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,490
I've taken a few liberties
in simplifying the text.

39
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,630
It's not exactly the same with the same
precision as the piece of text on top, but

40
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,840
they mean basically the same thing.

41
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,720
And the question we wanna ask now is,

42
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,439
how can we quantify the difference
between these two pieces of text?

43
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,210
So what we're going to do in this video,
as well as on your project,

44
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,670
is you're going to use something
called the Flesch readability score

45
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:30,990
in order to allow the computer to
quantify how readable a piece of text is.

46
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,310
You can see the formula for
the Flesch readability score here.

47
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,840
And the Flesch readability
score was developed by

48
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,550
an author named Rudolf Flesch.

49
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,910
And what it looks like is the following.

50
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:47,111
So the idea behind the score is that
you have this constant out front,

51
00:02:47,111 --> 00:02:48,911
this 206.858.

52
00:02:48,911 --> 00:02:54,690
And then, from that constant, you're
going to subtract two different terms.

53
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,580
And that's going to basically lower the
potential; Flesch score that you can get.

54
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,770
So in order to understand
how this formula works,

55
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,320
we need to look at those two terms that
we're going to be subtracting from that

56
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,880
constant to understand what a high score
means, and what a low score means.

57
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,500
So let's first think about
what makes this formula high.

58
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,280
So what makes this formula high,
since we're subtracting two terms,

59
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,410
is if these two terms we're
subtracting off are relatively low.

60
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,320
So what does it mean?

61
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,690
When are these two terms relatively low?

62
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,820
Well, they're relatively low if
there are few words per sentence,

63
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,560
then that ratio is going to be low.

64
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,800
And few syllables per word,
then that second ratio is going to be low.

65
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,140
So, in other words, if we're dealing
with short sentences and short words,

66
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,240
those two terms will be low leading
to a very high Flesch score.

67
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,390
So now intuitively we can see that a high
Flesch score, and in practice above 90,

68
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,810
leads to a very easy
to read piece of text.

69
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,500
On the other hand,
if we have those two terms be high,

70
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,770
in other words we have a lot
of words per sentence, and

71
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,840
a lot of syllables per word we're
gonna end up subtracting off a lot

72
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,388
from our initial constant and
end up with a very low Flesch score.

73
00:04:09,388 --> 00:04:14,690
So a Flesch score of below 30 is a piece
of text that's very difficult to read.

74
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,830
And that again makes sense.

75
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,819
If you have long sentences with long words
the text is gonna be more confusing.

76
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,890
Now then we have these constants
out in front of those two ratios

77
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,440
that basically just weight
those two terms accordingly.

78
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,530
And those are just determined by Flesch to
match our intuition about how text is easy

79
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,950
or difficult to read.

80
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,350
And in this case it basically
means that longer words

81
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,610
make text a little more difficult
to read than longer sentences.

82
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,529
So more syllables are bad basically.

83
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:47,716
So, if we apply that to their two pieces
of text, we can see that the piece of text

84
00:04:47,716 --> 00:04:51,482
on top, that confusing text,
has a very low Flesch score, 12.6.

85
00:04:51,482 --> 00:04:55,415
And that corresponds to basically a post
graduate reading level, which everyone

86
00:04:55,415 --> 00:04:59,950
basically agrees, you need to be a lawyer
in order to understand this document.

87
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,010
And that piece of text on the bottom, my
paraphrase of it that's got a much higher

88
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,160
Flesch score of 65.8, and
that's about a 10th grade reading level.

89
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,490
So my six year old maybe wouldn't be
able to read this and understand it.

90
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,760
But people with secondary education
should do a pretty good job of

91
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,190
understanding what that sentence means.

92
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,260
So, how does this relate to
what we're about to talk about?

93
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,770
Well, in order to calculate the Flesch
score for text, what do we need to know?

94
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,250
We need to know the number of
words in the piece of text.

95
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,883
We need to know the number of sentences.

96
00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:31,190
And we need to know
the number of syllables.

97
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,610
Now if we imagine that our piece of text
is just represented as one big long string

98
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,130
in Java,
we're going to need to be able to do

99
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,370
manipulation with those strings
in order to calculate that score.

100
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,110
And that's what we're gonna
look at in the next video.
