  The practice quiz you just took was not easy.  If you got it all right, congratulations!  But if you struggled, you're not alone.  In particular, many learners find the question involving regular expressions with split and getTokens quite difficult.  We will be asking you similar questions on the end of module quiz (which is graded) so if you had a hard time with the questions on this practice quiz, here are some suggestions to improve your understanding before you take the end of module quiz:
 </p>
 <ol bullettype="numbers">
  <li>
   <p>
    Open eclipse and play around with the getTokens method. You can do this in the main method of the BasicDocument.java class, which you will find in the document package.  You'll see a lot of other code there, and the programming assignment will explain this more, but in a nutshell, you can create a new BasicDocument with any text you like, and then call getTokens, passing in different regular expressions to see what happens.  To see the String array returned you can either print it (using a loop) or explore Eclipse's debugging features, which allow you to set breakpoints in your code and see the values of the variables.  (We won't teach you to use the debugger explicitly, but there are lots of good tutorials online).  You can also create String objects and compare them, call the split function on them, etc.
   </p>
  </li>

   <p>
    After playing with the code, if you find a topic that you're still confused about, then go back and watch the corresponding video again.  It'll probably make a lot more sense now!
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Finally, use the discussion forum to answer any lingering questions.  We've got a discussion prompt  coming up next to help you get comfortable actively participating in the community of learners who are all here to help each other learn.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Finally remember, at the end of this module you have a programming assignment, but you also have a quiz. There will be questions on that quiz which look a lot like the questions on the quiz you just took.  Good luck!
