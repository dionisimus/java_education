00:00:06,875 --> 00:00:10,063
This week you're going to dive into
your first real programming assignment,

3
00:00:10,063 --> 00:00:12,890
which is to calculate
the readability of a piece of text.

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:18,230
To do so, you'll learn all about strings,
a really fundamental data type in Java.

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,490
You'll also learn about something
called regular expressions,

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,740
which can be really useful
when working with strings.

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,080
There's a lot to learn this week but
if you feel ready, we encourage you to go

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,390
through the core videos and
then tackle that project right away.

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,954
If you need a little bit more support,
we've got it, so check out those concept

00:00:34,954 --> 00:00:38,719
challenges and the support videos,
as you go through this week.
