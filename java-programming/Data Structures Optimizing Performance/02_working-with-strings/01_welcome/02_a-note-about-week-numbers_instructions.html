  This course was originally designed as a five-week course, but we decided to split the first week into two to give you a little more time to settle in and prepare for the programming assignments.  We have tried to update the week numbering for the programming assignments and quizzes, but occasionally (for example in videos) we were not able to easily update the week number, and you might see a week number that is off by one.  For example, in the video overview of the programming assignment for week 4, you might notice that the instructions in the video say "Module 3" at the top, but the assignment is the same as the week 4 assignment for this course.

  We've probably missed some updates, so please feel free to let us know if it's something that's easy to fix.  If it's embedded in a video, however, just imagine that the correct week number is there.  :)
