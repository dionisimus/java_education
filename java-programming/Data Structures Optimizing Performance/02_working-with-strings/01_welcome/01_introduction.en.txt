[MUSIC] This week you're going to dive into
your first real programming assignment, which is to calculate
the readability of a piece of text. To do so, you'll learn all about strings,
a really fundamental data type in Java. You'll also learn about something
called regular expressions, which can be really useful
when working with strings. There's a lot to learn this week but
if you feel ready, we encourage you to go through the core videos and
then tackle that project right away. If you need a little bit more support,
we've got it, so check out those concept challenges and the support videos,
as you go through this week.
