[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03,912 --> 00:00:06,666
So you've already seen the full text
editor that you are going to be

3
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:08,580
implementing as part of this course.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,140
But in this video, I'm going to give you a
quick overview of what you'll be adding in

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,900
this week's project,
your first programming assignment.

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,133
So here's our text editor, and you can see
that there are a bunch of buttons over

7
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:18,448
here for what I can do with text.

8
00:00:18,448 --> 00:00:21,849
And this week we're going to be
focusing on this flesh index button.

9
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:25,303
So what this button is going to do
is it's going to give you a score,

10
00:00:25,303 --> 00:00:28,030
which is a measure of how
readable a piece of text is.

11
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,340
Let me just demonstrate this behavior
with a couple of passages of text which

12
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,830
may be familiar to you.

13
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:38,050
So the first piece of text that I'm going
to test out is from the book Peter Pan.

14
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,784
So here is Peter Pan, and
I can find this book on Project Gutenberg.

15
00:00:42,784 --> 00:00:46,760
And I'm just going to take the first
few paragraphs in Peter Pan.

16
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,840
Copy them out of Project Gutenberg and
copy them in to the text application.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,642
And now I'm going to press
this Flesch index score and

18
00:00:54,642 --> 00:00:57,843
I can see that this piece of
text has a score of 81.23.

19
00:00:57,843 --> 00:01:01,418
Now we'll be getting to a little bit more
what exactly the Flesch index is over

20
00:01:01,418 --> 00:01:02,970
the course of this week.

21
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,960
But just know that, that score,
it's a pretty readable piece of text.

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,645
Which makes sense,
because this is a piece of text,

23
00:01:09,645 --> 00:01:12,039
this is a story that was written for
children.

24
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,700
So let me compare that to something else.

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,660
Let me go over here and
pick a very different book.

26
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,020
A Picture of Dorian Gray by
Oscar Wilde not a piece of text,

27
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,570
not a piece of literature that was
meant necessarily for children.

28
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,900
So let me go down here
to the actual story and

29
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,680
again pick the first few
paragraphs of the story.

30
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,333
And now I'll go over
here into my text app.

31
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:38,543
I'll replace the text there and
let me now calculate the flesch index for

32
00:01:38,543 --> 00:01:39,726
this piece of text.

33
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:43,460
Wow okay, so 25.88,
that's a much lower score.

34
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,326
That indicates that this piece of text
is a much harder to read piece of text,

35
00:01:48,326 --> 00:01:50,392
it's for more mature readers.

36
00:01:50,392 --> 00:01:54,093
So you can play around with this once
you've implemented this functionality.

37
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:57,204
Figuring out the readability of
different pieces of text and

38
00:01:57,204 --> 00:02:00,743
coming right up you're going to learn
what this flesch index score is.

39
00:02:00,743 --> 00:02:02,743
How to work with strings
to calculated it and

40
00:02:02,743 --> 00:02:05,782
how to integrate this functionality
into this text application.

41
00:02:05,782 --> 00:02:06,514
Have fun.
