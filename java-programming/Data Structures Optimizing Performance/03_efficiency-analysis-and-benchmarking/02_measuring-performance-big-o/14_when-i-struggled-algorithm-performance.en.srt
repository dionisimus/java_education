2
00:00:03,565 --> 00:00:06,450
So this is a slightly different
kind of When I Struggle video.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,570
This isn't when I struggled when
I first learned the material.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,200
This is when I struggled
basically last week.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,023
What happened was,
I bought a padlock for my backyard.

6
00:00:16,023 --> 00:00:19,280
So that my son isn't able to get out of
the yard when he's playing back there.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,310
And as you know, with padlocks,
you can set the combination.

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,200
Well, something went wrong when I was
trying to set the combination and

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,150
somehow or another it was locked and
I didn't know the combination.

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:33,696
So I'm stuck with this quandary, go buy
a new lock or essentially brute force.

11
00:00:33,696 --> 00:00:36,296
One by one, check every combination.

12
00:00:36,296 --> 00:00:40,880
And this ties in so well to what Mia's
been explaining about algorithm analysis.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,985
Because, I essentially have a best case,
an average case, and a worst case, and

14
00:00:43,985 --> 00:00:47,130
I had to compare that against
the cost of buying a new one.

15
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,980
So the best case, is I try the very
first combination, say zero, zero, zero,

16
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,800
and it works.

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,724
That'd be fantastic,
the worst case though,

18
00:00:55,724 --> 00:00:58,583
is I might go from 000 all the way to 999.

19
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:00,160
And that could take a really long time.

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,170
And that'd be really bad.

21
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,500
And then the average case really is well,
on average I'm gonna find this around 500.

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,085
So being a bit frugal,
I decided I actually want to try it and

23
00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:14,329
I ran through all the combinations.

24
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:17,214
I actually got to 338 when it opened.

25
00:01:17,214 --> 00:01:17,934
So I got lucky.

26
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:22,150
It's a little bit better than my
average case expectation on the time.

27
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,670
So what I encourage you to do when you are
learning about all these abstract concepts

28
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,100
related to computer science,
try to relate it to the real world.

29
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,180
See how it's applying to
you in your everyday life.
