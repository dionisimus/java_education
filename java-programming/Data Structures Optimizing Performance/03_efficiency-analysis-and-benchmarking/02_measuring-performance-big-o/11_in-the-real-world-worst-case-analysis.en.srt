You may wonder,

2
00:00:07,878 --> 00:00:10,560
why is worst-case analysis useful?

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,148
After all, that's not what users
are gonna see most of the time.

4
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:18,480
And it's true that other kinds of
analysis can be really helpful as well.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,290
For instance, best case analysis can
let you know right up front if there's

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,880
no way that the algorithm is
gonna work for you at all.

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,900
If you know that even the best
case scenario it's gonna take

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,170
five years to finish this job,
that's probably okay, great, we're done.

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,030
Time to look for something different.

10
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,690
But worst case analysis is important
because that's what people remember.

11
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,530
Google, if most of your searches
take less than a second to complete,

12
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,960
and here's your answers and
it's great, cool.

13
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,180
And we could have the bet
answers in the world, and

14
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,620
we like to think that we
try to give you that.

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,360
But if every so often running a search
takes on the order of 10 minutes,

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,940
20 minutes to complete
because there's a worst case

17
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,870
divot that just takes that long,
you're not gonna use this.

18
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,310
You're gonna go to somebody else,
because who's got 20 minutes to wait

19
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,610
even if you know you're
answers are gonna be good.

20
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,260
So, best case performance
is great to know.

21
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,130
Average case performance is great to know.

22
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,270
But worst-case scenario
is really the killer, and

23
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,280
that's what we've gotta know, because
if the worst case isn't good enough,

24
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,790
then it's not good enough, and that's it.
