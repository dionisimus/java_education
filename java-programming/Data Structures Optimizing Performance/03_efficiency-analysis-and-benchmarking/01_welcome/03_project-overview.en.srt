2
00:00:03,406 --> 00:00:06,763
In this video, I'll show you the output
of your next programming assignment,

3
00:00:06,763 --> 00:00:09,480
the programming assignment for this week.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,970
In terms of the interface
that text editor interface,

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,150
you're not gonna be adding
any additional functionality.

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,010
You'll be implementing an efficient
document class, which is going to

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,380
do the same thing that your basic document
class did, only it's going to do it.

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,460
You guessed it, more efficiently.

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,210
And then you'll be implementing
some benchmarking to actually

10
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,700
compare the running time
of your basic document

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,090
with the running time of
your efficient document.

12
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,150
So what I'm gonna show
you is the run of this

13
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,280
document benchmarking program
that you're gonna write.

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,740
So I've written it,
I've got the solution in this file.

15
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,330
And I'll show you what it does,
and then I'll show you how you'll

16
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,500
use Google Sheets to do some analysis and
the visualization of the data.

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,540
So here's the demo,
you're going to press run,

18
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,340
right here on your DocumentBenchmarking
class once you've got it running.

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,330
And then you go over
here to the console and

20
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:58,160
you can see that it's printing out
the output of these efficiency tests.

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,140
Then you can just let that run.

22
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,320
All right, it'll take a little while, but

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,960
when it finally finishes
you'll have this output here.

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,060
You'll have the size of
the document that you are testing.

25
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,880
You'll have the performance
running time for basic document.

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,970
And the running time for
the efficient document.

27
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,080
And again,
you'll be writing the file that does this.

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,200
You'll be writing
the program that does this.

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,270
Then what we want you to do is, you're
gonna take all this data and copy it out.

30
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,150
And go on over to Google Sheets.

31
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,100
And then I'm just gonna
paste in this data.

32
00:01:29,726 --> 00:01:32,174
All right,
now I've got my data pasted in and

33
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:35,780
you're gonna see a button
down here that says Explore.

34
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,600
You're gonna press that button, and
I'm not gonna press it because this is

35
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,270
the solution code and I don't want you to
see the graphs that I get when I run this.

36
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:48,020
I want you to see your own graphs and I
want you to explore the data on your own.

37
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,540
So you'll explore the data using this
button and it's really pretty cool

38
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,990
of what you'll see from running
these table implementations and

39
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,450
then visualizing the data.

40
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,290
So, throughout this week,

41
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,210
you're gonna learn all the tools you
need in order to do this comparison.

42
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,490
Do this benchmarking.

43
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,509
Implement the efficient document and
have a lot of fun playing with the data.
