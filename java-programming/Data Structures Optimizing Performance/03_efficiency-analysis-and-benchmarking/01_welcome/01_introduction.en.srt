[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:07,706
So in this module,

3
00:00:07,706 --> 00:00:12,970
what we're going to do is take the next
step as software engineers and developers.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,540
Instead of just focusing on solving
problems, we're going to be analyzing and

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,040
refining our solutions.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,260
And so this means that we're starting to
think about performance in a deeper way

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,630
and we'll be talking both of
asymptotics and benchmarking
