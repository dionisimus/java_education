00:00:03,285 --> 00:00:08,066
Great, now you have completed your first
analysis of the web server log file data

2
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:09,460
that you read.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,980
You wrote code to figure out how
many unique IP addresses there were,

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,360
which gives you a good idea of how
many people visited your site.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,850
Doing this gave you some great practice
with ArrayLists which are useful for

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,150
solving a wide variety of problems.

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,240
And you also learned about Java's
two different notions of equality.

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,780
== which, tests if it's operands
refer to exactly the same object and

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,470
the .equals method which checks if two
objects have the same logical meaning.

10
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,720
Each class can define this method however
it needs to, so that it can provide

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,730
the appropriate definition of
having the same logical meaning.
