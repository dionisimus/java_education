00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,680
Welcome back.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,440
You have already written code
to read a web server log file,

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,280
parsing each line into a log entry object,
and creating an array list of them.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,550
Now it is time for you to write some
code to analyze the data you have read.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,300
The first problem you're
going to solve is finding out

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,150
how many different people
visited a website.

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,950
You don't want to just look at how many
elements there are in your array list,

8
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,890
since some people may have visited
your website multiple times.

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,130
So you need some way to distinguish
requests from different places.

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,820
You can use the IP address as recorded
in the log file to tell where

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,680
the request came from.

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,140
Using the IP address is not perfect,

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,730
since you cannot distinguish between
different people using the same computer.

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:54,240
But how many different IP addresses
you see is a very good estimator for

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,450
how many different
people visited the site.

16
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,910
As you might recall from programming and
the web for beginners,

17
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,240
an IP address is the address of
a device on the internet, whether that

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,510
device is a traditional computer,
a mobile phone, or something else.

19
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,610
So what you are going to need
to do to solve this problem

20
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,420
is take the array list that you
have read the log entries into and

21
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,720
find out how many distinct
IP addresses are in it.

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,220
Have fun.
