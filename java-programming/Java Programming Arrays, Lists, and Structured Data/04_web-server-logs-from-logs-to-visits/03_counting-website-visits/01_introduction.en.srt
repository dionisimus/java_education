00:00:03,296 --> 00:00:07,089
Now it's time for you to solve
a new problem with web server logs.

2
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:11,314
For this problem you'll be writing
a program to determine how many times each

3
00:00:11,314 --> 00:00:13,370
user visited the website.

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:18,020
This information can be quite useful for
understanding how people use your website.

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,540
Do the same people visit
your site repeatedly?

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:25,430
For example this person keeps coming
back to the site again and again.

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,860
Her IP appears many times in the log file.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,890
Seeing the same visitor
repeatedly coming to your site

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,960
might indicate that they find the website
useful because they keep coming back.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,610
By contrast, this person visited
the site once, but never came back.

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,170
Maybe it wasn't what he was looking for,
or maybe he found the site hard to use.

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,860
If most users only visit your site once,

13
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,230
it might suggest that there are some
issues you would want to look into.

14
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,180
Of course, as with all problems,

15
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,280
the techniques you are going to learn
are useful in a wide variety of

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,530
other problems, not just those
dealing with web server log analysis.

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,620
So, let's dive right in.
