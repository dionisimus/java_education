00:00:03,758 --> 00:00:08,708
Congratulations you have solved the
problem of counting how many times each

2
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,340
user has visited a site.

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,493
You solved this problem using Hashmaps,
which you learned about previously and

4
00:00:14,493 --> 00:00:17,860
should be becoming quite
proficient with by now.

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:22,450
That proficiency is great, as HashMaps
are really useful data structure

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,270
to solve a lot of different problems.

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,540
You also saw how you could use
the solution to this problem

8
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,440
to solve a different problem easily.

9
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,740
You could just take the size of
the resulting HashMap to figure out

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,900
how many unique IP addresses
there are in the log file.

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:46,200
Being able to realize when the solution to
one problem can be used to solve another,

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,690
is a very useful skill to work on
as you develop as a programmer.
