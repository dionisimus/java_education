1
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:07,964
Now, you're going to write some programs
and analyze web server log files.

2
00:00:07,964 --> 00:00:10,670
Most major web servers log
each access to a file,

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,716
which records who made the request,

4
00:00:12,716 --> 00:00:17,930
when the request was made, what their
request was, and how the server responded.

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,050
So why would you want to
analyze web server logs?

6
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,040
A web sever's log file lets
you understand a lot about

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,160
how your website is being used.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,380
You might want to know,
how many people are visiting your site?

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,640
Is it popular or not?

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,780
If you have many different pages, are they
all getting traffic or only a few?

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,370
Understanding how your site is being
used is particularly important

12
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,350
if you're trying to make money off of it.

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,360
Popular pages bring in revenue,

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,170
while pages that nobody looks at
are not helping your business.

15
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,780
The log file can also be
useful in diagnosing problems,

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,709
as it will tell you when your
server is experiencing errors.

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,460
If one of the pages isn't getting
traffic because a link to it is broken,

18
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,980
you want to know, so you can fix it.

19
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,150
In the rest of this lesson,

20
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,840
you're going to work on code to
read the contents of a log file.

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,910
Being able to read the contents of a log
file will set you up to solve a variety of

22
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:15,150
problems, such as figuring out how many
different visitors have come to a website

23
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,100
or how many times each
visitor has visited the site.
