1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,730
In this lesson you learned
a bit about web server logs,

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,850
which can give you a lot of
information about your website.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,420
You learned what is in them,
how those records are formatted,

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,530
as we looked at the Apache web
server documentation together.

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,290
And then you learned how
to make a LogEntry class

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,930
based on the information in that file.

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,120
As part of that,
you learned about toString,

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,130
which is an important Java concept,

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,550
as you will want to write a toString
method in many of the classes you create.

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,890
Finally, you wrote code
to read in the log file

11
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,840
using the parsing code that we provided.

12
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,010
Now, you are ready to write some code
to analyze the data you've read in.
