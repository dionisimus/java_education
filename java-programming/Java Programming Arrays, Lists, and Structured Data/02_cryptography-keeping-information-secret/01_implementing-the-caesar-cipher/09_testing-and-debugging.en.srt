1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,790
Now, we've written and
tested our CaesarCipher class.

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,470
We tested it out on one message and
it looked like it worked.

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,080
Does this mean we can be
sure our code is correct?

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,158
Of course not.

5
00:00:15,158 --> 00:00:19,460
Remember, when you're testing software
each test case makes you more confident

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,060
in your code, but no number of tests can
guarantee that your code is correct.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,200
You want more and
more tests to be more and

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,720
more confident and
one test case generally isn't enough.

9
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,170
So, here I have a different method.

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,670
Dear Owen,
no matter what you may have heard,

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,570
thee's no cake in the conference room.

12
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,030
The cake is a lie.

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,550
Please keep working on Coursera videos.

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,970
So I wanna encrypt this, and
send an encrypted message to Owen.

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,530
To fend him off from the cake in case
he intercepted my message to Robert.

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,360
I'm going to use my test Caesar.

17
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,800
And now I'm going to do message2.txt.

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,720
And when I look to at this, I'm going to
see that the D in dear turned into a U.

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,670
That's good.

20
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,940
But then e, a, and r were left the same.

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,520
Then the O in Owen turned into an F.

22
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,710
But then w, e, n were all left the same.

23
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,390
And in fact, most of this is unchanged.

24
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,650
So my code isn't quite right.

25
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,470
If I look back at it, I'm gonna see
that it's only going to work with

26
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,640
capital letters and
not with lower case letters.

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,540
This was the problem in
our first test case.

28
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,230
It only had capital letters.

29
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,337
It didn't have lower case letters, so we
didn't really test all the cases enough.

30
00:01:32,337 --> 00:01:34,587
We're gonna leave this to you to fix.

31
00:01:34,587 --> 00:01:37,697
There are a couple of different
ways you can do it, and

32
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,921
we hope you can figure one of them out.

33
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:43,004
So good luck, and
happy fixing of your code.
