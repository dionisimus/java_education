00:00:03,646 --> 00:00:07,140
Let us wrap up this lesson
where you learned a lot.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,070
First, you learned a bit about
the historical, as well as,

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,691
modern importance of cryptography.

4
00:00:11,691 --> 00:00:15,703
Then you learned some more concepts
about strings, as well as,

5
00:00:15,703 --> 00:00:19,668
how to use a StringBuilder to
efficiently construct a string.

6
00:00:19,668 --> 00:00:22,090
Then you learned about counting for

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,110
loops, adding another important tool
to your programming repertoire.

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,100
Finally, you implemented
the Caesar Cipher, a classical cipher,

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,370
dating back thousands of years.

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,580
As you will learn in the next lesson, this
cipher is not secure by modern standards,

11
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,620
but it is a good starting point to
understand the ideas of cryptography.
