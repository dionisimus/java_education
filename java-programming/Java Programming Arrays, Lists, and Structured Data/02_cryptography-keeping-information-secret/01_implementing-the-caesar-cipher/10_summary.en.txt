Let us wrap up this lesson
where you learned a lot. First, you learned a bit about
the historical, as well as, modern importance of cryptography. Then you learned some more concepts
about strings, as well as, how to use a StringBuilder to
efficiently construct a string. Then you learned about counting for loops, adding another important tool
to your programming repertoire. Finally, you implemented
the Caesar Cipher, a classical cipher, dating back thousands of years. As you will learn in the next lesson, this
cipher is not secure by modern standards, but it is a good starting point to
understand the ideas of cryptography.
