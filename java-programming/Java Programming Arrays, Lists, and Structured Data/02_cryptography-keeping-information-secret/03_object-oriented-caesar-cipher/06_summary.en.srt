00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:04,118
In this lesson,

2
00:00:04,118 --> 00:00:09,170
you'll learn some of the basic concepts
of object oriented programming.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,470
You'll learn about encapsulation,
the idea of putting code and

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,350
data together in an object,

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:19,285
such as the methods of the object act on
the data that's inside the same object.

6
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:23,280
You learned about fields,
which are also called instance variables.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,450
They let you declare data that
should be inside of objects.

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,880
And you learned about visibility
modifiers, private and

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,440
public, which let you expose or
restrict access to fields and

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,560
methods, so you can enforce abstractions
and provide the interface you want.

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,250
Finally, you learned about constructors,

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,991
which let you write code specifying how
to initialize the objects you create.

13
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,180
When you do object oriented programming,
it's called OO programming,

14
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,640
giving you OO7, license to code.
