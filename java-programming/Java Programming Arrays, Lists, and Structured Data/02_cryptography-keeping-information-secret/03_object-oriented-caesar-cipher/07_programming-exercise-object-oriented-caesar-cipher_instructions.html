  Assignment 1: One Key
 </h3>
 <p>
  In this assignment, you will put together the
  <strong>
   CaesarCipher
  </strong>
  class from the lesson and add a
  <strong>
   decrypt
  </strong>
  method to decrypt with the same key. In addition you will create a second class,
  <strong>
   TestCaesarCipher
  </strong>
  to test examples that use the
  <strong>
   CaesarCipher
  </strong>
  class, including writing a method that will automatically decrypt an encrypted file by determining the key and then decrypting with that key.
 </p>
 <p>
  Specifically, you should do the following.
 </p>
 <p>
  Create the
  <strong>
   CaesarCipher
  </strong>
  class with the following parts:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Private fields for the
    <strong>
     alphabet
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
     shiftedAlphabet
    </strong>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Write a constructor
    <strong>
     CaesarCipher
    </strong>
    that has one int parameter
    <strong>
     key
    </strong>
    . This method should initialize all the private fields of the class.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Write an
    <strong>
     encrypt
    </strong>
    method that has one String parameter named
    <strong>
     input
    </strong>
    . This method returns a String that is the input encrypted using
    <strong>
     shiftedAlphabet
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Write a
    <strong>
     decrypt
    </strong>
    method that has one String parameter named
    <strong>
     input
    </strong>
    . This method returns a String that is the encrypted String decrypted using the key associated with this
    <strong>
     CaesarCipher
    </strong>
    object. One way to do this is to create another private field
    <strong>
     mainKey
    </strong>
    , which is initialized to be the value of
    <strong>
     key
    </strong>
    . Then you can create a
    <strong>
     CaesarCipher
    </strong>
    object within
    <strong>
     decrypt
    </strong>
    : CaesarCipher cc = new CaesarCipher(26 - mainKey); and call cc.encrypt(input).
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Create the
  <strong>
   TestCaesarCipher
  </strong>
  class with the following parts:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Include the methods
    <strong>
     countLetters
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
     maxIndex
    </strong>
    that you wrote in the previous lesson.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Write the void method
    <strong>
     simpleTests
    </strong>
    that has no parameters. This method should read in a file as a String, create a
    <strong>
     CaesarCipher
    </strong>
    object with key 18, encrypt the String read in using the
    <strong>
     CaesarCipher
    </strong>
    object, print the encrypted String, and decrypt the encrypted String using the
    <strong>
     decrypt
    </strong>
    method.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Write the method
    <strong>
     breakCaesarCipher
    </strong>
    that has one String parameter named
    <strong>
     input
    </strong>
    . This method should figure out which key was used to encrypt this message (in a similar manner as the previous lesson), then create a
    <strong>
     CaesarCipher
    </strong>
    object with that key and decrypt the message.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    In the
    <strong>
     simpleTests
    </strong>
    method, add a call to
    <strong>
     breakCaesarCipher
    </strong>
    on the encrypted String to decrypt it automatically by determining the key, and print the decrypted String.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 </p>
 <h3 level="3">
  Assignment 2: Two Keys
 </h3>
 <p>
  In this assignment, you will put together the
  <strong>
   CaesarCipherTwo
  </strong>
  class that encrypts a message with two keys (the same way as the previous lesson:
  <strong>
   key1
  </strong>
  is used to encrypt every other letter, starting with the first, and
  <strong>
   key2
  </strong>
  is used to encrypt every other letter, starting with the second), and also decrypts the same message. In addition you will create a second class,
  <strong>
   TestCaesarCipherTwo
  </strong>
  to test examples that use the
  <strong>
   CaesarCipherTwo
  </strong>
  class, including writing a method that will automatically decrypt an encrypted file by determining the two keys that were used to encrypt it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Specifically, you should do the following.
 </p>
 <p>
  Create the
  <strong>
   CaesarCipherTwo
  </strong>
  class with the following parts:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Include private fields for the
    <strong>
     alphabet
    </strong>
    ,
    <strong>
     shiftedAlphabet1
    </strong>
    , and
    <strong>
     shiftedAlphabet2
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Write a constructor
    <strong>
     CaesarCipherTwo
    </strong>
    that has two int parameters
    <strong>
     key1
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
     key2
    </strong>
    . This method should initialize all the private fields.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Write an
    <strong>
     encrypt
    </strong>
    method that has one String parameter named
    <strong>
     input
    </strong>
    . This method returns a String that is the input encrypted using the two shifted alphabets.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Write a
    <strong>
     decrypt
    </strong>
    method that has one String parameter named
    <strong>
     input
    </strong>
    . This method returns a String that is the encrypted String decrypted using the
    <strong>
     key1
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
     key2
    </strong>
    associated with this
    <strong>
     CaesarCipherTwo
    </strong>
    object. You might want to add more private fields to the class.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Create the
  <strong>
   TestCaesarCipherTwo
  </strong>
  class with the following parts:
 </p>

    Include the methods
    <strong>
     halfOfString
    </strong>
    ,
    <strong>
     countLetters
    </strong>
    , and
    <strong>
     maxIndex
    </strong>
    that you wrote in the previous lesson.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Write the void method
    <strong>
     simpleTests
    </strong>
    that has no parameters. This method should read in a file as a String, create a
    <strong>
     CaesarCipherTwo
    </strong>
    object with keys 17 and 3, encrypt the String using the
    <strong>
     CaesarCipherTwo
    </strong>
    object, print the encrypted String, and decrypt the encrypted String using the
    <strong>
     decrypt
    </strong>

  <li>
   <p>
    Write the method
    <strong>
     breakCaesarCipher
    </strong>
    that has one String parameter named
    <strong>
     input
    </strong>
