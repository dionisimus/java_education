00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,250
>> Welcome back.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,890
In this lesson, you are going to learn
about the two visibility modifiers that

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,320
you saw in the object-oriented
version of the CaesarCipher.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:18,010
Public, which was used here, and
private, which was used here.

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,960
There are two other visibility modifiers,
however.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,840
Explaining them requires some
more advanced concepts, so

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,780
you will only learn about these now.

8
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:32,100
When you declare something, whether it is
a class, field, method, or constructor as

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,600
public it means that any code, anywhere
in your program can access that thing.

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,720
Code from any class can call a public
method, read or update a public field,

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,770
use a public constructor when making
an object, and make use of a public class.

12
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,670
By contrast, when you declare
something private, it tells Java that

13
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:58,150
only code inside of this particular class
can see the thing you declare private.

14
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,370
These two fields are declared private so

15
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:05,140
all of the code inside of the CaesarCipher
class can read and update them but

16
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:10,410
code outside of the CaesarCipher class
is not allowed to access them at all.

17
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,730
So what happens if you write code that
tries to access private fields or

18
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,420
methods from outside the class?

19
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,380
The Java compiler will give
you an error like this,

20
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,090
which says that you are not
allowed to do that.

21
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,942
In general,
when you get this sort of error,

22
00:01:24,942 --> 00:01:28,590
it either means that you
are improperly using a class.

23
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,130
Especially if it's a class that
is part of an existing library.

24
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,120
Or that you have designed a class and
made something private that should not be.

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,080
So why do you want to
declare things as private?

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,090
After all, it seems like it would just
be easier to make everything public.

27
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,350
So you can just access whatever you want,
wherever you want.

28
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,270
Remember the idea of distraction?

29
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,500
The principle that you want to separate
the interface from the implementation.

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,690
Restricting the visibility of
the implementation details

31
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,610
helps you enforce abstractions you design.

32
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,770
You can make the interface of a class,

33
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:09,210
all the methods that other classes
are supposed to call public, and

34
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,290
then you can make
the implementation details private.

35
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,010
No other class should know about
the implementation details directly.

36
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,070
And declaring them private lets you
enforce that rule in your code.

37
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:27,130
In our CaesarCypher example, you want
other classes to be able to call encrypt.

38
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,170
But they should not know about
the implementation details,

39
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,420
such as the fact that you made
a variable called shifted alphabet.

40
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,930
Keeping these details private
means that you can change them and

41
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,230
be sure that no other code relies on
the private implementation details.

42
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,860
As you start to think about designing
your own classes, there are a few general

43
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,460
pieces of guidance to get you started
on how to choose public or private.

44
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,640
First, fields are generally part of
the implementation of an object.

45
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,210
So they typically should be private.

46
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,010
For methods it depends on what
the purpose of the method is.

47
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,490
If the method is part of the interface
you want your class to have,

48
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,748
that is part of the behaviors you want
it to provide to other pieces of code,

49
00:03:11,748 --> 00:03:13,660
you should declare that method public.

50
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,850
On the other hand,
some methods are helpers.

51
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:22,800
You array them to abstract out specific
complex tasks which are not meant for

52
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,810
other classes to call.

53
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,860
They just help accomplish
the public interface.

54
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:33,500
These methods should be private so that
only the code in your class can call them.

55
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,880
For classes,
you should always declare them public.

56
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,540
As you become more skilled in Java, you
will learn some more advanced topics that

57
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,640
lead to situations where you
might want non-public classes.

58
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,530
But for now, always use public.

59
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,120
Likewise, for constructors, you should
always make these public for now.

60
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,240
Typically, constructors are part of
the public interface of a class.

61
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,000
They specify how to make an instance.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,190
There are situations where non-public
constructors are appropriate.

63
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,202
But as with non-public classes,

64
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:09,840
these only come up when you have
learned some more advanced topics.

65
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,290
So for now,
you should just make constructors public.

66
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,100
Great.

67
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,490
So now you know what public and
private mean.

68
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:22,140
Why they are useful and
some general guidelines for

69
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,220
how to use them in your own classes.

70
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,720
Thank you.
