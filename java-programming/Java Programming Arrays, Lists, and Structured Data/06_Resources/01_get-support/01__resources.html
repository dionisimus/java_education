  General FAQ:
 </h2>
 <p>
  <strong>
   When will I have access to the lectures and assignments?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as you enroll in a course, you will have access to all videos, quizzes, and programming assignments (if applicable). Peer review assignments will only become available once the session you are enrolled in has officially begun. For example, if you enroll in a session that begins on January 1, you will not be able to access the peer review material (if applicable) until January 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you choose to explore a course using the
  <em>
   audit option
  </em>
  (if applicable), you may not be able to access certain assignments.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   I see there are dates and deadlines. Will I be penalized if I miss a deadline?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  There are no penalties if you miss a deadline or turn in an assignment late. All sessions will have a weekly schedule of suggested deadlines. These are only a suggestion to keep you on track to finish the course within the session you are enrolled in.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most assignments can be submitted at any time before the session ends. However, you might not get enough peer reviews on peer-reviewed assignments if you submit them late.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What if I need additional time to complete the course?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Most courses run on sessions that start every 2-4 weeks. If you fall behind or feel you need more time to complete the course, you can switch to the next session. Your grades and progress will transfer to the new session and there is no limit to the number of sessions you can join, so feel free to take as much time as you need to complete the course.

  Enrollment FAQ:
 </h2>
 <p>
  <strong>
   I want to take the course, but do not want the certificate. Can I take the course free?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  To take a course on Coursera, you'll need to enroll. When you enroll in a course, you'll see different payment options for that course. For some courses you may see an option that says "Full Course, No certificate". This option lets you see all of the course material, allows you to submit required assessments, and get a final grade. You
  <strong>
   will not
  </strong>
  receive a Course Certificate with this option.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some courses on Coursera will have an audit option, which lets you see most course materials for free, but you
  <strong>
   will no
  </strong>
  t be able to submit certain assignments or get grades for your work and you
  <strong>
   will not
  </strong>
  receive a Course Certificate
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Can I enroll in a single course that is part of a Specialization?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Some courses that are part of Specializations are only offered through subscription payments. You can’t make a one-time payment for a course on a subscription model.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you only want to take a single course, you can subscribe to the Specialization for as long as it takes you to complete that course, then cancel your subscription once you finish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some users might see an option to subscribe to the entire Coursera catalog. If you subscribe to the entire catalog, you’ll still need to enroll in a course to see course materials, but you won’t need to pay for the course, since it is included in your subscription.
 </p>
 <p>
  If a course or Specialization is open for enrollment, the next session dates will be listed on the course or Specialization home page.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   I completed all of my assignments early and passed the course, when will I receive my Course Certificate?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Course Certificates are issues at the end of the enrolled session and once all verification steps have been processed. Once a certificate has been issued you can find it on your Accomplishments page.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Can I use the Course Certificate for credit at Duke University or for credit at another institution?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently
  <strong>
   does not
  </strong>
  offer credit for taking a Coursera course at Duke University and we cannot speak for another institution as to whether or not they will accept Coursera courses for credit. This is something you will have to ask your particular institution.
