00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:07,787
Hi, we're gonna walk through
the process of adding a new label to

2
00:00:07,787 --> 00:00:12,060
the GladLib.java program and
the GladLib class.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:17,160
A new label might be something like
verb which would go along with noun,

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,630
color and the other labels we have.

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:20,610
To do that,

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,740
you've seen part of that process
outlined in one of the previous lessons.

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,960
What I'm going to do here is show
you that to add a new label we need

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,120
a new template file, so I've taken the
standard template file that we had before,

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,360
which was called madtemplate.txt and
I've replaced sing and dance, the two

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,270
things that a creature would do in the
stories we generated, with verb and verb.

11
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:53,670
So I'm adding the label verb to replace
sing and dance in the original story.

12
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,770
I still call this madtemplate.txt.

13
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,130
You will use whatever text editing
software you have which is

14
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,708
usually something like
TextEdit on a Mac or

15
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:06,530
Notepad++ on a Windows machine,
but you can use any text editor.

16
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,190
Now I'm going to take the GladLib
program that we've used before, and

17
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,640
I'm going to walk through the locations
where we need to make changes.

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,140
I need to create a new array
list to store my verbs.

19
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,720
I'm going to go along with the same
conventions that have been used before and

20
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,600
make sure that I use verbList to go
along with adjectiveList, nounList, etc.

21
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,820
As I scroll through my source code,
I see that these

22
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,630
ArrayLists are initialized in
the initializeFromSource method.

23
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,440
It's called from our class's constructor.

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,120
I need to initialize verbList.

25
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,440
And its going to be
initialize by calling readIt.

26
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,860
Passing the source.

27
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:53,270
Which is either a place on my computer
where it can access files, or a url.

28
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,450
This is verb.txt.

29
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,240
I'm going to also have to
make one other addition.

30
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,490
Because now my label might be
an adjective or an animal or a name.

31
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,090
But I'm going to need to copy and
paste these so

32
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,940
that in addition to using timeframe,
I'm going to use verb.

33
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,300
So I'll replace that,
make sure I get the syntax right.

34
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,170
If the label is verb, I'm going to
replace the label from verblist.

35
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,910
I'm going to compile my program.

36
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,336
I know that in this program it's reading
the template form madtemplate.txt

37
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:42,580
which I've modified to include the angle
bracket verb angle bracket label.

38
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:47,820
I'm going to create a new
GladLib on my object work bench.

39
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,800
And then I'm going to run
the Make Story method.

40
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,910
It so loved to unknown and unknown.

41
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,620
There was a funny, slippery lion
named Vivian that scared it so much.

42
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,250
So if we go back and look at our source
code we'll see that it must have found

43
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:13,160
verb but failed to replace the verb with
the objects that it was replaced with.

44
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,240
In this case, I've got verb list here,
my instance variable.

45
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:25,830
I've initialized it from verb
here I've made sure that if,

46
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:31,670
oh look, if label.equals verb t,
I had a misprint when I spelled it.

47
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,870
Now it's got verb.

48
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,350
So I'm going to go back and recreate that.

49
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:43,040
Create my gladLib object,
open it up and make a story.

50
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,060
Hey, it's so loved to think and
contemplate, but there was a gigantic,

51
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,540
gigantic tiger.

52
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,100
Let me run that one more time and
see if I get something besides think and

53
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,320
contemplate.

54
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,550
It's so loved to ride and surrender.

55
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,910
One more time, and I'll be convinced
that it's actually reading verbs.

56
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,840
It so loved to surrender and

57
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,700
surrender, we've done nothing to make
sure that it can use the same word or

58
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,610
verb more than once, so
just to remind you what we've done.

59
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,520
I've used this location to
change when the label was found.

60
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,790
I've made sure that the label
was read from the source.

61
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:27,400
And I used verbList here, which is
the name of my instance variable here,

62
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,620
verbList.

63
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,490
Using the same naming conventions
we've used in all the other programs.

64
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:39,130
I compiled my program, I tested it,
I created a new text file to hold verbs,

65
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,100
and a new text file for the template.

66
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:42,780
Happy verbing.
