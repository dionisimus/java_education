00:00:03,186 --> 00:00:04,231
Hello.

2
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:08,679
Welcome to this module, in which we'll
use the idea of creating random,

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:14,580
hopefully entertaining stories to motivate
and explore important Java concepts.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,750
Here's an example of
a randomly generated story.

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,030
We use a couple of these stories
to introduce our Java concept.

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,150
Let's look at this first story.

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,820
My name is Albert, and I live in France.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,420
One day I'd like to travel to Mexico,
because I've never seen a tiger and

9
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,360
I read that they have
gigantic slippery ones there.

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,750
However, because 55 orange gigantic
wheelbarrows make it difficult to travel,

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,160
I may have to travel to Ecuador instead.

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,350
That would be okay, but
it might take 305 minutes to get there.

13
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,499
We'll look at another story
with the same pattern.

14
00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:58,281
Perhaps you can see some of
the similarities to the previous story.

15
00:00:58,281 --> 00:01:02,360
My name is Vivian, and I live in India.

16
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:08,330
One day I'd like to travel to
the United States, because I've

17
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:13,830
never seen a pangolin, and I read that
they have furious and funny ones there.

18
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,557
However, because 95 purple, slippery
houses make it difficult to travel,

19
00:01:19,557 --> 00:01:22,298
I may have to travel to China instead.

20
00:01:22,298 --> 00:01:27,901
That would be okay, but
might take 445 hours to get there.

21
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:30,181
There are many similarities
in these stories,

22
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:34,540
which isn't surprising since they
were generated by a common template.

23
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,400
You'll be exploring and modifying the Java
program that reads the story template,

24
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,780
finds replacement words where those
are needed, and generates a story.

25
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,910
The similarities in these stories are
captured in parts of this template, that

26
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:53,070
are replaced with words chosen randomly,
from lists of words of different types.

27
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,740
For example, you're program might
choose a name like Albert or Vivian.

28
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,880
And choose a country like India, France,
China, the United States and more.

29
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,860
Animals chosen could include tigers,
pangolins, and

30
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,130
whatever dragons you might imagine,
for example.

31
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,190
Your program can choose nouns.

32
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,220
And as you'll see, the choices
can make for interesting stories.

33
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,850
You'll be able to share words that
are chosen at random with other learners,

34
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,520
as you explore these new Java concepts.

35
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,360
Let's get started.
