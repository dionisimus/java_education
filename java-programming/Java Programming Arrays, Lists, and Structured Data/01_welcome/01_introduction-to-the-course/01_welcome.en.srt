1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,160
[SOUND] This is Duke University.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,392
>> Hi, I'm Susan and

3
00:00:03,392 --> 00:00:09,210
I'm really excited to be working with our
team at Duke to introduce this course.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,610
Java Programming, Arrays,
Lists, and Structured Data.

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,300
We've designed a great set of problems and
programs that combine real world data

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,000
analytics with lessons that
introduce security and cryptography.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,100
Whether this is your first
course with our great team, or

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,380
you're coming from our previous courses
as part of Java programming and

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,010
introduction to software specialization.

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,090
You'll use a seven-step
process to help you design and

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,730
implement Java programs
to solve problems and

12
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,720
hone the skills that will help you
become an effective software engineer.

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,020
In working on the problems we've designed,
you'll learn about arrays and

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,800
maps, two standard data structures
that are used to create efficient and

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,450
robust programs to solve problems.

16
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:01,090
As part of our cryptography lesson,
you'll learn how the words melon and

17
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,220
cubed are related by the number 16.

18
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,830
>> Hello, I'm Drew.

19
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,980
In this course, you'll be using the
edu.duke library of classes we've designed

20
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,920
to write programs that solve interesting
problems, like analyzing web logs, and

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,190
generating random stories from templates.

22
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:22,020
But you'll also use the standard java.util
library of classes that will help you grow

23
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,530
your knowledge and skill in using java
to create solutions to these problems.

24
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,920
Understanding APIs so you can use code
from libraries is an important part of

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,420
this course, as is beginning to develop an
understanding of object-oriented program.

26
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,600
In this course, you'll learn
how classes are structured and

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,460
how programs are created by strategically
combining classes together.

28
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,480
You'll also learn about
how the words fusion and

29
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,764
layout are related by the number 20.

30
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,250
>> Hi, I'm Robert.

31
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:51,930
For this course,

32
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,910
we've designed an exciting mini-project
as part of this course to help you learn

33
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:00,220
more about classes, object-orientation,
and data structures.

34
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,450
You will use standard techniques and
libraries that are part of nearly

35
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,350
all java programs designed
to solve problems at scale.

36
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,140
We've structured the module in this
course to introduce topics, and

37
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,420
then explore them in more detail,
and with more robust,

38
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,580
scalable solutions that improve
upon that initial program.

39
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,330
This allows you to learn the new
techniques while solving

40
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,040
a familiar problem.

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,359
We hope that this learning approach will
facilitate success for all learners.

42
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,100
Also in this course, you'll learn
how the number 19 connects to words,

43
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,398
jolly and cheer.

44
00:02:32,398 --> 00:02:35,190
>> Hi, I'm Owen.

45
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,940
I'm excited about the approach
we've taken in this course

46
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,820
to introduce two important programming
structures, arrays and maps.

47
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,100
These are not simply Java structures.

48
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,020
They are used in every programming
language to create efficient solutions

49
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,920
to programming problems.

50
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,980
By exploring how these structures are
related and encountering them in familiar

51
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,250
contexts, you'll be able to practice
using them as you develop mastery with

52
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,030
both concepts and the Java libraries
that anchor these concepts in code.

53
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,570
You'll also learn why having 14 fake toys

54
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,730
would be an enormous
cryptographic coincidence.

55
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,567
Welcome to arrays,
lists and structured data.
