1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:06,260
[APPLAUSE]
>> All right, now we get to have some fun.

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,430
In that last video that Mia presented,
she showed you how to work with GUIs

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,620
in Java and
specifically using the processing library.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,790
And in this video we're gonna
actually write some code together

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,630
to create a fun little GUI.

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,930
So, I hope you're at your computer.

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,620
You should open up Eclipse.

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,250
You should navigate to the package, to the
project, where you've got all the code set

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,830
up for this class that we set up in Module
1, and you'll be ready to get started.

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:30,490
Okay, so

11
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,680
we're gonna get started by creating
a new package to place our code in.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,840
So let's go over here
to our source folder,

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,670
and I'll right-click and
I'll create a new package.

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,460
So here's my new package.

15
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,100
I'm gonna call my package GUI module.

16
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,560
Okay, so I've got a new package
to put my new class in it.

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,900
It's always a good idea to organize
your classes in packages so

18
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,040
they don't just become a mess
that's all unorganized.

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,310
So inside this new class
there's our new package.

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,490
I am going to create a new class.

21
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:08,250
So I go over here,
right-click again and say New > Class.

22
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,180
And I'll call my class MyDisplay and
create it.

23
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,570
So here's my new class.

24
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,950
So let me get rid of this window
here cuz I don't need it anymore.

25
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,450
So I've got my new class all set up.

26
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,840
And if you remember back from Mia's video,
the way I'm gonna turn this class in to

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,670
a class that represents a GUI is I'm
going to make it extend with this

28
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,610
magical keywords extends, that we're
gonna talk about next module, I promise.

29
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,306
And it's going to extend
the PApplet class.

30
00:01:40,306 --> 00:01:45,280
All right, so that PApplet class, it's,
Eclipse is giving me an error on that.

31
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,680
It's saying, I don't know what the PApplet
class is, and it turns out it's actually

32
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,840
smart enough to fix this error for
us by importing the correct class for me.

33
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,300
So f I go right down here and I go yes,

34
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,780
I want to import that PApplet class,
it will do that for me.

35
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,320
So it adds that import line for
me and I'm ready to go.

36
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,410
So now if you remember back from the video
as well you know that there are two magic

37
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,370
methods that we have to implement
in order to get our GUI to display.

38
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,800
So let's implement those now.

39
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,040
So they are public void setup.

40
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,850
That's the code that gets run right at
the beginning of when that GUI starts up.

41
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,870
And then there's this other
method public void draw, and

42
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,220
that's the method that's gonna get
called every time the GUI is redrawn,

43
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,850
which actually turns out
happens quite a bit.

44
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,940
So I've got our two methods set up and
ready to go, and

45
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,710
now in fact this GUI will run.

46
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,710
So let's try it out.

47
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,360
Let's look at what happens
when I press play.

48
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,350
Great.
So when I press play,

49
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,040
I see a small window here.

50
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,600
That's my GUI.

51
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,450
It's kind of a boring GUI, so
let's do something interesting with it.

52
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,880
Let's start first by playing
with the size of that window.

53
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,180
So, you may remember from the video,
we have this method called size, and

54
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,560
I can pass in parameters,

55
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,070
the width that I want my window to be and
the height that I want my window to be.

56
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:09,510
So I'll make a 400 by 600 size window and
then run that again and see what happens.

57
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,040
There we go.

58
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,290
My window is both wider and
taller than it was last time.

59
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,090
So there's my new window.

60
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,390
Now, it's always a good idea to
just write a tiny piece of code and

61
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,160
then play around by pressing Run, and

62
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,020
we're gonna use this method a lot as we
write this GUI code, especially GUI code.

63
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,070
It's almost impossible to tell what you're
writing if you don't actually see it, so

64
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:33,830
we'll be writing a couple lines, running
it, and it'll be kinda more fun that way.

65
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,500
So now that we've got our window set up,
actually I want to make my window square,

66
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,245
so I'm gonna make
a window that 400 by 400.

67
00:03:40,245 --> 00:03:42,400
Let's start playing around with color.

68
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,050
So I want to first change
the background color of this window.

69
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,510
And in order to do that, I need to
remember that there's a method that I can

70
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,420
call that will change
the background color.

71
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,420
Now, we might not remember what that
method is called, but that's okay.

72
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,970
And that's where our documentation
is going to come in handy.

73
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,660
So I'll use that page in a second.

74
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,930
But for now, I want to show
you the documentation page for

75
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,990
the processing library.

76
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,534
So here is the documentation page for the
processing library, and if you just search

77
00:04:09,534 --> 00:04:13,310
for processing documentation you
should be able to find this page, or

78
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,530
the URL is right here.

79
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,256
And I can look right here
at this color column and

80
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:21,482
see I've got a number of methods that
will change the color of my drawing,

81
00:04:21,482 --> 00:04:24,960
and one of them right here
is called background.

82
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,770
So if I click on the background method,

83
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,920
I see that there are a number of different
versions of this background method.

84
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,000
Remember that overloading we talked about
in module, in that last module on objects.

85
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,288
And you can see that there's a method,
there's a version of it that takes one

86
00:04:38,288 --> 00:04:41,120
parameter, three parameters,
takes an image parameter.

87
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,106
I'm gonna focus here on the one
that takes three parameters and

88
00:04:44,106 --> 00:04:47,010
explain that in a little bit more detail.

89
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:51,460
So that three parameter background method,
what it's doing is it's

90
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:58,130
taking three values which
are respectively the red, green, and

91
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,840
blue amounts that I want in my color.

92
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,240
So we're defining a color in terms
of its red, green, and blue.

93
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,830
And that's a standard way of
representing color on a computer.

94
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:13,980
So if I say I want no red, no green,
and no blue, I pass in all zeros.

95
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,881
And take a minute to guess about what
color you think this is gonna be.

96
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:24,030
All right, let's try to run it, and
see what happens, see if you were right.

97
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,110
Nope, it has errors.

98
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,090
I forgot a semicolon.

99
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,610
No problem, I'll fix that.

100
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,240
Now I'll run it, and now you can
see that this background is black,

101
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,810
because I have no red light,
no green light, no blue light.

102
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,260
So no light at all gives me black.

103
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,412
If I want white,
I can change these colors to,

104
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:48,457
these channels to all their maximum value,
which is 255.

105
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:56,050
And you can see that I'm going
to get a white background.

106
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:56,970
So there's my white background.

107
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,890
And I can play around with the color here.

108
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,476
I can change it to red
by making the blue and

109
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:08,770
the green channels both 0 and run again,
so there's my red background,

110
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:12,020
and I can keep playing around to get other
combinations of red, green, and blue.

111
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,690
But if you get tired of playing around,

112
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,610
there are plenty of sites on
the internet that you can go to.

113
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,110
Here's one that I like that
will allow you to pick an RGB,

114
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,580
sorry pick a color visually and
then it tells you what its RGB value is.

115
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:29,380
So, if I like this nice kinda teal color,
I can see that its red, green,

116
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,350
blue value are in those boxes below.

117
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,860
I think I copy those values
out into my processing window.

118
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,392
Okay, so I want my background
to be just a kind of plain grey.

119
00:06:40,392 --> 00:06:45,070
So I'll put it at 200, 200, 200.

120
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:49,077
And incidentally, whenever I have a red,
green, blue value that are all the same,

121
00:06:49,077 --> 00:06:50,497
I'll get some shade of grey.

122
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:53,780
The lower the numbers, the closer
to black, the higher the numbers,

123
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,790
the closer to white.

124
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,950
Okay, I've got my window setup.

125
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,740
I've got my canvas setup,
it's just gonna be a grey square.

126
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,930
And I am ready to draw a picture.

127
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,550
But we're gonna,

128
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,430
in order to keep these videos from getting
too long, I'm gonna break the video here.

129
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,780
Feel free to go off and play, start
creating your own image on this GUI, or

130
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,640
you can come back to the next video and
we'll draw a happy face.
