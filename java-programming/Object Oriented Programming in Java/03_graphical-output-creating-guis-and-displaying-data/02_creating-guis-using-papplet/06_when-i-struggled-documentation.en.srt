[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:06,470
So I remember first
starting to write code.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,580
And at the beginning, I was told that
documentation's really important and

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,600
that we should comment everything.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,103
And not just the step by step,
each line put a comment, but also,

6
00:00:16,103 --> 00:00:20,567
when we first define a method, that there
should be a little description in Javadoc

7
00:00:20,567 --> 00:00:22,702
that other people might be able to use.

8
00:00:22,702 --> 00:00:26,844
And this other people notion was just
sort of vaguely said by, oh by the way,

9
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:29,420
someone might wanna use your method.

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,670
I always thought it was kind of
silly because if we do the other

11
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,530
recommendations and name variables
appropriately and the name of the method

12
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:44,380
should maybe be something that's natural,
then who would need the documentation?

13
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,420
And then I started using
other people's code,

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,060
because I started writing more complicated
programs, and using libraries.

15
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,500
And all of a sudden, I was reading
other people's documentation.

16
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,850
And when they didn't put very much in
there, other than the name of the method

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,520
or the name of the variables,
it would be really frustrating.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,770
I'd have to do a whole lot of testing and
trial and error to try and

19
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,170
figure out what these methods are doing.

20
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,640
And so I learned the hard way that
documentation's really important.
