2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,740
Think back to the programs that
you've written up until now.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,660
And if you think back to them, especially
if you've had to start from scratch,

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,760
their functionality may have
been a little bit limited.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,710
Maybe you're interacting with files,
text files, or command lines.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,460
Maybe you're letting your user
type in a couple of things,

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:28,080
in order to determine what the program
does, or ask questions to the program.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,200
But what we'd like to do in this project,
and then in this course and specialization

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:38,630
as a whole, is ramp you right up to
medium and large scale programs,

10
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:43,450
to get you really experiencing what it's
like to develop code in the real world.

11
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:48,150
And so, by the end of this video
you'll be able to create one kind of

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,720
pretty sophisticated application, a GUI.

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,200
And, in order to do that you'll be
reading and using other people's code and

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,210
libraries, and in particular you'll
be using the Processing Library.

15
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,300
I wanna step back and
think about what we'll be doing, and

16
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,040
then we'll talk about how to do it.

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,049
So by the end of this video, you'll
have the tools to create a really cool

18
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:12,326
application, where for this particular
example, we have in the background

19
00:01:12,326 --> 00:01:16,670
an image one of my favorite beaches here
in San Diego, La Jolla Shores Beach.

20
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,900
And what we're going to do,
is we're going to add a second sun.

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,620
It's sunny enough in San Diego, but
we're going to add a second one.

22
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,900
And that second sun is going to
be like a visual clock for us.

23
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,380
And so what we're going to do is have
the color of the second sun that we've

24
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,640
drawn on change depending on
the actual time of day around us.

25
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,120
And so for example at noon, we want it to
be a bright yellowy, a bright yellow sun.

26
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,620
And then as the day gets closer to sunset,
the color maybe will be pinky red, and

27
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,390
then at dusk we'll go to gray, and
at nighttime it will black out, and

28
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,370
then at sunrise again,
we're going to have the sunshine.

29
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,550
So that's what you'll be
able to do by the end.

30
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,290
And this is really an example of a GUI,

31
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,320
which is a funny way of saying
Graphical User Interface.

32
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:01,970
It's an acronym.

33
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,020
And when you think about
graphical user interfaces,

34
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,490
maybe that sounds a little bit
complicated, but you can't use

35
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,800
a computer these days without interacting
with a graphical user interface.

36
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,410
They're really the programs that
we work with all around us,

37
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:23,530
from maps to development environments
like Eclipse, to browsers.

38
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,670
Everything around us has
elements like menus, or

39
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,980
icons, or response to mouse clicks,
has text boxes.

40
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,970
All of these elements that
we can draw on the screen,

41
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,940
display data to the user, invite
the user to interact with the program

42
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,280
by manipulating something on the screen.

43
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,100
Those are all graphical user interfaces.

44
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,960
So the application that we are working
on is a particular graphical example and

45
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,560
it's one that's displaying information.

46
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,150
In a couple of modules, you'll also be
able to incorporate interactivity and

47
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,510
have your graphical interface
respond to user input.

48
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,280
That's coming soon.

49
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,850
But for now,

50
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:09,730
let's think about how we might go about
coding some graphical user interfaces.

51
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,110
And we don't want to start from scratch.

52
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,490
What we'd like to do is think about
what other people have done before us,

53
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,020
stand on the shoulder of
giants as people say.

54
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:24,660
And there's all sorts of libraries
available to do GUIs in Java.

55
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,880
So you might have heard of some of
these names as you're Googling around,

56
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,805
seeing how to program in Java.

57
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:32,130
And everyone's got their favorite.

58
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,890
Some are older, some are newer.

59
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,230
In this course, we're going to be
using the processing library, but

60
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,150
something I want you to keep in mind
throughout this whole process is,

61
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:48,080
that it doesn't really matter
which library you end up choosing.

62
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,560
There are odds and
quirks about each one of them.

63
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,430
There's little tricks to do with how you
might choose one rather than the other.

64
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:01,210
But at the end of the day, the design
of the GUI is a high-level process and

65
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:06,170
it's a really important process, because
it will determine a lot of the usability

66
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:10,330
and the user experience of people who
are customers to your application.

67
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:15,070
So it's really crucial, not the focus of
this course, but when it comes down to

68
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:19,522
implementing a design, you can use
all sorts of different libraries and

69
00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:21,824
they'll all provide
the similar functionality, and

70
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:25,950
the way that they'll provide that
functionality is through documentation.

71
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,032
And so what we'll be talking about
in the rest of the videos that come,

72
00:04:31,032 --> 00:04:35,610
is how to use that documentation in order
to create this really cool application.
