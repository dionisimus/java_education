1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,520
[SOUND] All right.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,150
Welcome back to our sequence of videos
where we're building an application that's

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,862
going to indicate the hour of the day
based on the color of the sun that

4
00:00:12,862 --> 00:00:15,060
we've added to the picture.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,670
And up until now we've figured
out how to use a PApplet class

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:24,328
from the processing library, and we've
set up our canvas using the setup method.

7
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:28,570
And so now what we'd like to do is
fill in the draw method which is

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,080
going to let us display the content.

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,680
Okay, so what we'd like to do

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,422
is display the background image
that we brought into memory.

11
00:00:37,422 --> 00:00:41,240
And so
we can do that by using the image method.

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,560
Okay, so let's do just that.

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,588
We say image and
then (backgroundImg, 0,0).

14
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:49,780
And what does that do?

15
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,390
Well it seems to us like it's gonna have
something to do with background image but

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,780
the 0,0 at the end of that
are the coordinates that we want for

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,830
the position of the top
left corner of the image.

18
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,470
So in this method what we're doing is
we're saying we would like to draw

19
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,940
a particular image, and we'd like that
image to be located in our canvas so

20
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:14,690
that its top left corner is at 0,0, and
0,0 is the top left corner of the canvas.

21
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:18,541
And so that means that we're going to want
to have our canvas be at the very top and

22
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,130
very left.

23
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,310
Okay.

24
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,190
So lets see what happens if we do that.

25
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,330
[SOUND] Is that what you expected?

26
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,280
Remember that image that we
want is all of the beach.

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,880
And we're getting a bunch of blue but
it's familiar blue.

28
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,010
That blue is a sky blue,
and the reason for

29
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,850
that is that we're actually getting
just a tiny piece of the sky.

30
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,100
The image is way, way, way too big.

31
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,670
Our canvas is just 200
pixels by 200 pixels and

32
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,370
our image was, well it's a high-def
image we took with a modern camera.

33
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:53,290
So it's much more than that, if you think
about resolutions of images these days.

34
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:58,470
And so what we need to do in order to
display the whole image is to resize it.

35
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,690
So what we're going to need to do is
to figure out how to take a really big

36
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,020
image and cram it into the canvas
that we're working with.

37
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,010
And so we look up our handy documentation.

38
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,140
There's a theme here, right?

39
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,010
Keep looking at the documentation.

40
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:15,760
And we see that we have a resize
method that we can call, and we can

41
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,900
specify the width and the height that we
would like our image to be compressed to.

42
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,150
Now, our image already came
at a specified size, but

43
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,930
what we're doing in the resized image,
is we're saying, move, change it.

44
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,450
We want a new size, okay?

45
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:39,460
So let's try and say, maybe we want to
have our image just go 50 pixels across,

46
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,220
so it's only gonna go a quarter of the way
across our canvas, which was 200 by 200,

47
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,970
and it's gonna go half the way down,
so it's gonna be 100 pixels long.

48
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:53,230
And so we resize our image in memory,
and then we go ahead and display it.

49
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,651
Okay so it went a quarter of the way
across and half way down, so

50
00:02:57,651 --> 00:03:01,988
that did it, but notice how
warped the picture looks because

51
00:03:01,988 --> 00:03:05,150
the ratio of width to
height is totally off.

52
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,151
It's totally not what the original image
looked like and so we see the trees

53
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:13,156
look like they're reaching like
skyscrapers or something in this image,

54
00:03:13,156 --> 00:03:17,240
and it's not really giving us the kind
of image that we'd like to do.

55
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,000
And so what we'd like to do is be
a little bit, maybe more careful,

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,570
maybe we wanna use up the whole canvas,
and so

57
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:29,550
we could say let's use all 200 pixels
across and all 200 pixels down.

58
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:34,160
And so now we see the full image,
and we see it a little bit bigger.

59
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,670
But it's still not the right proportions.

60
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,210
The trees are still way too big,

61
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,360
it doesn't look like
the original image that we had.

62
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,210
And so maybe we do something
a little bit tricky, okay.

63
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:52,030
So what we've done here
is tricky in two ways.

64
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,110
Let's start with the 0
that we've got there.

65
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:00,730
And the 0 that we've got is the first
parameter of the resize method,

66
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:06,060
says I don't want to specify width,
I want to be lazy.

67
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:12,060
And the reason I want to be lazy is that
I want the proportions of my picture to

68
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,780
match the original, and so I only want
to specify one of the coordinates.

69
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,710
Just the y, just the height coordinate.

70
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:25,340
I want my picture to be
the full height of the canvas.

71
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,610
And then, Java,
you calculate the right width.

72
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,990
You calculate the right width so
that the aspect ratio, the ratio between

73
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,460
the width and the height, is maintained
to be the same as the original image.

74
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,230
Okay, so
if we put a 0 in one of the parameters,

75
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,768
that means that we don't want to
calculate both of the parameters.

76
00:04:43,768 --> 00:04:48,340
Java is gonna do it for us, so that
the original proportions are maintained.

77
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:53,350
The second tricky thing that we've done,
is instead of writing an actual number

78
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,890
in the second parameter,
we've written the word height.

79
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,730
And the advantage of doing that is
that height is an instance variable

80
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,600
in the PApplet class.

81
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,350
Which tells us the height of the canvas.

82
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,130
It tells us how many pixels
high the current canvas is, and

83
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,050
if you think about taking our canvas and
dragging it so

84
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:17,610
it's bigger, or smaller,
the height of the canvas is gonna change.

85
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,810
And this height variable will
change right along with it.

86
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:25,389
So what this does when we say that
the background image will have the size,

87
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,260
so that its height is
the height of the canvas,

88
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,410
it means that our image will
change right along with

89
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:37,370
the canvas as the user plays around
with the size of the canvas.

90
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,220
So we've made our picture dynamic.

91
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,110
We've put our background
image that we wanted

92
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,780
in the right proportions
in the background.

93
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,250
But we're still missing the sun.

94
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,250
So in the next video, we'll wrap
things up by putting the sun in.
