1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,210
[APPLAUSE]
All right, so

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,710
we've got our canvass all set up, and
we're ready to draw something on it.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,880
And as I've mentioned,
I wanna put a happy face on the screen,

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,900
because I like happy faces.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,320
So what I'm gonna need is some shapes,
to draw with.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,140
And the first thing I'll need is a head.

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,130
So I need to draw a head on my canvass,
and I want my head to be a circle.

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,910
So I don't know how to draw a circle,
I don't remember, so

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,460
I'm gonna go back over to my
processing documentation.

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,870
And if I go back to that overview screen,

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,350
I see that processing provides me
with a whole bunch of methods for

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,420
drawing shapes, and I've got some built
in what are called 2D primitives here.

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,710
And I can see that one of those
primitives allows me to draw an ellipse.

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,400
So I click on that.

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,220
And I see that, okay, it's pretty easy.

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,060
I just call the ellipse method,
I pass it in, four values.

17
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,740
And those values are the X and
Y coordinates of the ellipse, and then,

18
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,870
the width and height of the ellipse.

19
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,183
So let me go back over to my code and
try that out.

20
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:03,744
So ellipse,
I'll put it at position 50, 100.

21
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,468
And then, I'll have it be not too big,
I'll do it 75 by 75.

22
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:13,690
So there, I need my semicolon, and
let's see what that looks like.

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,130
All right, so when I put my ellipse on
there, I see that by default I get white

24
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,540
ellipse or circle in this case,
since the height and width are the same.

25
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:29,640
And it's appearing at exposition 50, so
it's 50 over from the left hand side,

26
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,780
and you can see thats it's actually 50
over to the center of that ellipse.

27
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:40,650
And then, it's, well, this is weird,
it's 100, but the whole window is 400.

28
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,110
And, normally,
you'd think about positive Y,

29
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,690
starting from this lower left hand corner,
and going up.

30
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,229
But if you remember back to me
as video and computer graphics,

31
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:53,945
positive Y is actually facing down.

32
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:58,029
And the 0, 0 points to the 0,
Y coordinate is way up here,

33
00:01:58,029 --> 00:02:03,817
at the top left corner of my document, so
it's the top that's the 0, Y coordinate.

34
00:02:03,817 --> 00:02:06,515
And then, Y gets bigger, as you go down.

35
00:02:06,515 --> 00:02:11,378
So with the Y value of 100 it's only about
a quarter of the way down my window.

36
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:14,924
If i want to bring it further down,
if i wanted at the bottom, near

37
00:02:14,924 --> 00:02:19,708
the bottom window, I'd have to make the Y
value very big, so I'd make it, say 300.

38
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:24,070
And you can see that that ellipse
moves all the way down the page.

39
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,010
All right, so I want a big happy face, and
I want the background of my happy face,

40
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,670
not to be white but to be yellow.

41
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,550
So lets look at how to do that.

42
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,070
So one thing I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna make my ellipse much bigger, and

43
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,510
I'm gonna center it in my window.

44
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,606
So my window is 400 by 400.

45
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:41,640
I'm gonna put it at 200, 200, and

46
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,224
I'm gonna make it 390 by 390,
so it's gonna be nice and big.

47
00:02:48,224 --> 00:02:51,090
And then, the other thing I'm gonna do is,
before I draw my ellipse,

48
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,880
I'm gonna change the color that
it's going to be filled with.

49
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,170
And the way I do that is
using the fill method.

50
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:01,110
So I fill it, and this time I'm
again gonna pass in an RGB value.

51
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,570
And I happen to remember that
yellow is made by doing red,

52
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,580
255, green, 255, and then, blue is 0.

53
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,670
At least I think so, so
let's try that out, and see what happens.

54
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,370
There we go, I've got a nice yellow
head that I can draw my face onto.

55
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,330
Great, so let's continue.

56
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,180
I now need some eyes, so let's think
about where these eyes are gonna go.

57
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,370
They're gonna go roughly, here, so let's
work on putting the first eye on our face.

58
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,200
So I want it to be kind of somewhere
in this upper left corner, of this GUI.

59
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,290
So let's try it out.

60
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:40,161
It's also gonna be an ellipse, but this
time it's gonna be a black ellipse, so

61
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:42,718
let's change the fill color to be black.

62
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:46,698
And then, Im gonna put another

63
00:03:46,698 --> 00:03:51,598
ellipse at position 75,75, and

64
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:57,429
I'll make my ellipse 50 wide, 70 high.

65
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:58,868
Lets just see how that looks.

66
00:03:58,868 --> 00:04:02,671
I could sit down, and I could do all
the geometry to make it look perfect, but

67
00:04:02,671 --> 00:04:04,050
I'm just gonna try it out.

68
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,440
Oh dear, I'm way off,
that eye is way off the face.

69
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,030
So let me try to correct that,
I need to move it down, and

70
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,520
a little bit to the right.

71
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,600
So 75 isn't quite right,
let's try a much bigger value,

72
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,070
a somewhat bigger value for the width.

73
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,611
Let's try 100 for the X position, and

74
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:26,411
then, let's try 130 in the Y position,

75
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:30,062
let's see what that looks like.

76
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:31,306
Okay, that's getting better.

77
00:04:31,306 --> 00:04:37,284
I'll maybe move it in a little
bit more and try that out, so

78
00:04:37,284 --> 00:04:43,430
100, I'll make that 120,
and see what happens.

79
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,344
Okay, that's not a bad place for the eye.

80
00:04:45,344 --> 00:04:48,835
So lets go ahead and
put another eye on my happy face, and

81
00:04:48,835 --> 00:04:53,588
I want this one to be the same height,
the same position down the canvas, but

82
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:55,842
equally far in from the other side.

83
00:04:55,842 --> 00:05:01,429
So let's just reason about what
the coordinates should be, ellipse,

84
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:06,468
let's see, so I want it to be
120 in from the right hand side.

85
00:05:06,468 --> 00:05:09,496
And we know the canvas is 400 wide, so

86
00:05:09,496 --> 00:05:14,394
I'll put it at position 280,
and the X direction, and then,

87
00:05:14,394 --> 00:05:20,200
it needs to be the same in the Y
direction, and the same size, so 50 by 70.

88
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,178
And I'll try that out.

89
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:25,110
All right, look at that.

90
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,930
I've got eyes, and all that's left to
do is give this a guy a happy face,

91
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,480
so I need a shape that
it is going to do that.

92
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,330
So, let's go back to the shapes list here.

93
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,540
And I see that I have
a shape here called an arc,

94
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,200
that's gonna come in quite handy for
that smile.

95
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,680
So an arc allows me to, basically,
trace the edge of an ellipse.

96
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,780
And the way I specify an arc is by
specifying the ellipse that I'm tracing.

97
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,970
So here's the X and
Y position of the ellipse that I trace.

98
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,281
And then, the width and
height of the ellipse that's being traced.

99
00:06:00,281 --> 00:06:05,016
And then, over here I have
the angle that I want to trace out.

100
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:11,790
So the 0 angle is right here, and then, it
goes around clockwise, all the way around.

101
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,200
And these angles are measured in radians.

102
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,570
So halfway around is going to be pi.

103
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,570
All the way around is going to be 2pi.

104
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:24,230
And they've got built in constants
that we can use for those values.

105
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,520
So let's go ahead and just try this out.

106
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,890
So I want to do an arc, and
I want the ellipse for my arc.

107
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,050
Let me just take a guess.

108
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:38,470
I'll put it at about 3, not 300,
200, it needs to be centered,

109
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:44,750
and about 280, so
down towards the bottom of my face.

110
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:52,089
And then, I will make it,
let's try 75 by 75.

111
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:58,157
And I'm gonna start it at angle 0 and
go through angle pi,

112
00:06:58,157 --> 00:07:02,745
which will bring me a half circle arc,
and let's try that.

113
00:07:07,388 --> 00:07:08,478
Okay, look at that.

114
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:10,320
[LAUGH] It looks pretty good, actually.

115
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,840
That's pretty cute.

116
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,320
I can make some tweaks,
if I wanna make some tweaks.

117
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,010
One tweak that i'll show you is that I
don't want this little face to have a full

118
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,390
mouth, I want the mouth to be open,
so there's this method called,

119
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:28,450
no fill, that will cause that
ellipse arc not to be filled in.

120
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:33,190
And if I run it, I can see that he
now smiles withnot such a full grin.

121
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:37,015
And I can change the parameters
to make the smile wider or

122
00:07:37,015 --> 00:07:40,340
to reposition it, but that looks like
a pretty, happy, little face to me.

123
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,260
So I'm gonna stop there.

124
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,250
I hope you'll play around with this.

125
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,780
Now that you've got basic methods,

126
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,900
that you can play around with,
you can have a lot of fun.

127
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,810
So go ahead,
make something really interesting, and

128
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,000
just have fun playing with it.
