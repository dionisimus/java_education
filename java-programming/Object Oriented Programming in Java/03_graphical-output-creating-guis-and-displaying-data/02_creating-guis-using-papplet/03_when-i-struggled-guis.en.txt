[MUSIC] So one thing I had a lot of trouble
with is Gooey and event handling. I remember when I learned it,
there was just so many different things that you have to
keep track of when you use these things and it just didn't make any sense to me. So what I did is, I took example code and
I made edits until it compiled and ran, and I kept running it and making modifications until it
ran the way I thought it should.
