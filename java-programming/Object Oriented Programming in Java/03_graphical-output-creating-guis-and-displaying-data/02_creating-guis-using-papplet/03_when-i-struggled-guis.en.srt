00:00:03,496 --> 00:00:08,210
So one thing I had a lot of trouble
with is Gooey and event handling.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,940
I remember when I learned it,
there was just so

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,970
many different things that you have to
keep track of when you use these things

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,720
and it just didn't make any sense to me.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,450
So what I did is, I took example code and
I made edits until it compiled and

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,870
ran, and I kept running it and

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,000
making modifications until it
ran the way I thought it should.
