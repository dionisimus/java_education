2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,427
In the programming assignment for
Module 3,

3
00:00:06,427 --> 00:00:09,480
we'll be overlaying information
about events onto a world map.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,180
For our assignment we've
chosen earthquake data.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,470
But you could use the same principles
to map out rates of disease,

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,540
social network activity, Internet
connectivity, and really much more.

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,200
There are three major
components to this assignment.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,740
The first is creating marks in
the world for recent earthquakes.

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,891
The second is to customize
those marks on the map,

10
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:34,600
based on the magnitude of the earthquake.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,367
And the last step is to create the legend,
over here on the left,

12
00:00:37,367 --> 00:00:39,590
to help someone understand
the markers on the map.

13
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,040
Some of these steps may
seem daunting right now but

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,200
we'll provide you code and
support to help you succeed.

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,493
Along these lines the next videos will
teach you how to create graphical user

16
00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:54,060
interfaces or
sometimes called GUIs in Java.

17
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,087
We'll work through some examples with
unfolding maps in the processing

18
00:00:57,087 --> 00:00:57,940
libraries as well.

19
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,750
Now if you're already familiar
with designing GUIs and

20
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,870
these libraries, feel free to skip ahead
to the project walk-through video so

21
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,130
you can get up and
running with the project.

22
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:08,760
We hope you have fun.
