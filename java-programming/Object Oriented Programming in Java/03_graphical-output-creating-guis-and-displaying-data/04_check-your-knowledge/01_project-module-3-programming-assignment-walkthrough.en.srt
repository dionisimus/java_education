00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,810
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,667
In this video, we'll walk through
on how to accomplish the goals

3
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:09,480
of program assignment
associated with Module 3.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,090
Now how do we start
working with a project?

5
00:00:15,228 --> 00:00:17,630
Now this video's gonna be a little
bit different from the last one.

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,460
Rather than diving straight into the
source code I'm gonna try to walk through

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,390
how to get started with
a project in general.

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,040
Now, for

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,950
this course the best thing to do is to
start by watching the overview video.

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,250
So if you haven't watched the programming
assignment overview video yet,

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,750
you'll wanna do that now.

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,270
Because the overview video
gives you a clear idea

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,470
of what's gonna be required of
you by the end of the project.

14
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,650
It's important to have
that high level view.

15
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,140
In fact, from just that video, you know
that for this project you're going to take

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,929
a map that's given to you and add recent
earthquakes as markers onto that map.

17
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,840
Then you're gonna make
the markers appear different

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,910
based on the magnitude of the earthquake.

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,570
And lastly, you're gonna add a legend so

20
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:07,410
if someone's looking at your map they
know what, say a large red circle means.

21
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,399
Well, that means,
it's this magnitude of earthquake.

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,660
So those are the three big pieces
we know of the assignment.

23
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,661
Now if you didn't have an overview
video like we just provided,

24
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:20,730
you'd wanna try to glean that same idea by
reading through this project description.

25
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,590
Now after watching that video,

26
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,130
the next step is to really to read
through the project description.

27
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,890
We put a fair amount of effort into
making sure these project descriptions

28
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,450
are clear to you.

29
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:36,660
This also means though that this product
description may change with time.

30
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,440
So it is not quite the same as you see in
this video it's because we change it and

31
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,280
try to make it better for you.

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,260
So the first step is really to
start reading top to bottom.

33
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,030
So what are the big learning outcomes?

34
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,580
What's expected of you for this?

35
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,880
We'll read through the introduction.

36
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,562
As you're reading though look for

37
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:57,356
things to keep in mind as you
go forward with the project.

38
00:01:57,356 --> 00:02:00,584
For example, when you read this it says,

39
00:02:00,584 --> 00:02:04,930
that you're gonna be reading
live data from a RSS feed.

40
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,000
You may not what a RSS feed is,
you may not know how to parse length.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,450
So there's kind of a question
in your mind, then.

42
00:02:11,468 --> 00:02:15,020
Are you gonna be required to
write the code to read the RSS or

43
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,300
is that provided to you?

44
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,820
So we wanna look for
that when we look at the code later.

45
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,220
Just keep reading through
the introduction.

46
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,947
You'll notice that in a number of these,
we're gonna tell you resources have open.

47
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,759
Now when you're working
through a programming project,

48
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,980
it's almost always a good idea to have
Java reference open on your computer.

49
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,160
Pull up Chrome tab, have that open right
there, and then you can just start

50
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,460
looking for the features that you need and
the references that you need.

51
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,880
This is true for
essentially all program projects.

52
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,030
Though my own personal experience,

53
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,810
I found it absolutely essential
in working with a GUI.

54
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,660
Because when you're working with a GUI,
there are tons of libraries.

55
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,500
And it's not that important to memorize
how to say write text on a GUI.

56
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,570
Because you just look upm how do I write
text in the processing library with a GUI,

57
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,090
and you'll find there's
a method called text.

58
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,060
So again, not important to memorize
these kind of methods because you can

59
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,530
always look them up.

60
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,890
So right now open up another tab in
Chrome and essentially open up these two.

61
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,340
After you have those open, it's important
to walk through what you'll do.

62
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,910
Now, the overview video that I already
provided gives you a pretty clear idea of

63
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,750
what's required for this assignment.

64
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,790
But if we didn't have that overview
video you'd wanna read through this

65
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,090
fairly carefully.

66
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,380
And at the very least read kinda
the bolded high level points.

67
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,260
You're gonna see that your first steps
gonna be to open up the starter file for

68
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:39,970
this assignment.

69
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,710
To trace through the starter code and

70
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,350
predict what's gonna
happen when you run it.

71
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,520
Since that's your second step, by the way,
I'm going to make sure when we look at

72
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,360
the code not to run it, so that you can
still walk through this step on your own.

73
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,870
Then you're going to want to
add code to display markers for

74
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,730
each of the earthquakes.

75
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,580
Then you'll add code to style each of
those markers based on the magnitude of

76
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,982
the earthquake and then you're
gonna add the code to draw the key.

77
00:04:04,982 --> 00:04:07,920
Now there's a whole bunch of
details that I just skipped over.

78
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,000
You can always come back to these when
you get to those steps in the project.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,640
But right now you gotta really clear
idea of what's required of you.

80
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,070
The next step is to figure
out what we've given to you.

81
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,650
So, dive into your code.

82
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,540
This is really step one here and
I'll walk through it with you.

83
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,390
Dive into your code and see what's there.

84
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:31,860
So what I have here is Eclipse open,
I'm in Module 3 of our UCSD employee maps

85
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,697
collection and
we have our earthquakecitymap.java file.

86
00:04:37,697 --> 00:04:39,439
This is the code that we provide you.

87
00:04:40,528 --> 00:04:44,190
Now, you're gonna see a number of
things in common with the last project.

88
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,280
For example, there's still this boolean
flag, which if you're working offline,

89
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,110
you need to set it to true.

90
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,300
If you're working online,
you can just leave this alone.

91
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,990
You'll now notice there's
two threshold values.

92
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,765
This is gonna be really useful when we
start looking at changing the appearance

93
00:05:00,765 --> 00:05:03,239
of the earthquake markers
based on the magnitude.

94
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,310
We've got a map just like
we had the last project.

95
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,240
We've got a URL,
which looks like it's associated with

96
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,210
the RSS feeds, and
then just like our last project we have

97
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,820
a setup method that's gonna
create a p applet of this size.

98
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,240
We're gonna create a map,
these two maps right here.

99
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,870
If you're offline,
you're gonna use our local provider.

100
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,390
If you are online you can
use a Google Map provider.

101
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,128
You're going to zoom at a certain
level of the map, and then just

102
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:39,440
like in the last one, this is gonna
make it so that the map is interactive.

103
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,550
We'll dive into the details again about
how that's interactive in a later module.

104
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,560
As we scroll down,
now we're into some really new stuff.

105
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,420
A list of markers.

106
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,500
This looks like this is where we're
gonna keep, essentially markers for

107
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,450
all the earthquakes.

108
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,900
And down here, it looks like we've
got a list of all the earthquakes,

109
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,630
which we're gonna get from the RSS feed.

110
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,070
In fact, wait this is good news, right?

111
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:08,270
We've got a parse feed class that has
a method called parseearthquakes.

112
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,055
So remember what I said back when
we we're looking at the RSS feed,

113
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:12,260
we should keep this in mind.

114
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,150
Is this something we're gonna have to do,
or is this code provided to us?

115
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,260
Turns out,
it's code that's provided to you.

116
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,570
If you're curious, though,
about how to parse an RSS feed,

117
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:26,060
feel free to go into our parsing section,
go into the parsefeed.java.

118
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,120
You can open that up.

119
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,020
You can see how we parse these RSS feeds.

120
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,270
But it's not critical and you can do this,
essentially, if you want on the side.

121
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,670
Back to our code,
you'll notice that the very next step has,

122
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:46,750
if we essentially have pulled in some
earthquakes, do something with that.

123
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,490
You can work through this
code kinda line by line, but

124
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,970
essentially at the high level, it's taking
an object from this earthquakes list,

125
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,080
which is a point feature, and
converting it into a magnitude.

126
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,770
That's fantastic,
because we're gonna need magnitudes later,

127
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,960
when we're trying to decide how
to display these earthquakes.

128
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,310
So let's keep this in mind as
a useful thing going forward.

129
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,640
Looks like we also have
a color yellow created for

130
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,580
us, because we're gonna want to
make one of the markers yellow.

131
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,920
And now we're getting to our to-do's.

132
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,532
So, our first to-do is to say,
create all the markers,

133
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:27,040
and now attach them to the map.

134
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,660
Now, it looks like we already have
a list of all the earthquakes.

135
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,010
It's just a matter now of converting
all our earthquakes into markers.

136
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:40,160
Now, if you're not quite sure how to
do that, we give you a helper method,

137
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,070
which takes a point feature and
converts it into SimplePointMarker.

138
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,743
This will help you get started for
essentially creating all the markers and

139
00:07:47,743 --> 00:07:48,770
then adding them to the map.

140
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,918
So this method isn't quite done yet.

141
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,530
You may wanna change the appearance of
the markers based on the magnitude.

142
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,310
And this is probably
the good place to do that.

143
00:08:00,485 --> 00:08:03,790
You'll notice that we still have draw
method, which draws the map, and

144
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,940
it also adds this thing called addKey.

145
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,350
You scroll down some more and you're
gonna find that that's a helper method,

146
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,910
and it looks like we're gonna
use this to draw the key or

147
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,930
the legend on the left hand side.

148
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,820
We're gonna draw this using
the processing graphic methods.

149
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:23,000
At this point, we got a pretty good
idea of what's required in this project.

150
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,300
You can really get started.

151
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,290
Now, if you run into any problems,

152
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,000
remember that there are a number
of hints in the write-up.

153
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,900
So look at those hints first and
then if you still have problems,

154
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,280
feel free to turn to the forums or
other lectures from this module.

155
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,050
I hope you have fun, good luck.
