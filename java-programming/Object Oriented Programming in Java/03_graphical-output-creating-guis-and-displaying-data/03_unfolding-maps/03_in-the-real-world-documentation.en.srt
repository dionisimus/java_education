2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,262
People always say that it's important to
document your code, but we don't always

3
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:13,910
talk about why, and there's a couple
different reasons we do it.

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,360
One is because you want your code
to be usable by other people.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,720
If you've written the world's best
library for string parsing or

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,735
other stuff like that, but no one can
figure out how to use it, it's no good.

7
00:00:28,735 --> 00:00:30,610
And so there's one reason right there.

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:36,050
Documentation might be in the form of
an external document, a how-to guide,

9
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,760
a design document or something like that.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,840
Or it might be in the form of something as
simple as documents inside of your code

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,040
saying, here's how you use this function,
these are what we're looking for, for

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,400
these parameters, and stuff like that.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,060
There's other reasons for
documenting your code too, though.

14
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,210
Somebody once said, you should always code
as if the person who ends up maintaining

15
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,560
your code will be a violent
psychopath who knows where you live.

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,990
That's a little extreme, I haven't run
into too many violent psychopaths in my

17
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:12,290
professional career, but
it is something to bear in mind.

18
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,630
You're writing code that other people
are gonna have to maintain, and so

19
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:22,470
this means not just writing documentation
for the parts that other folks will use,

20
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,670
here's how you use my object or
here's how you call this function.

21
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,540
But it's also writing documentation for
the people who will have to go in and

22
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,560
fix your code, or extend it to do
different things or other stuff like that,

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,060
as needs or the environment changes.

24
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,340
And sometimes that violent
psychopath might be you.

25
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,040
There have been times when, as
a professional, I've had to go back in and

26
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,400
revisit code that no one has looked at for
years.

27
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,710
And I go in there, I'm like,

28
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,250
wow, who's the idiot who wrote
this stuff in the first place?

29
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:02,304
Oh, wait, that's my name on this file,
I'm the idiot, yeah, okay.

30
00:02:02,304 --> 00:02:07,030
It's not always somebody else,
or from a different perspective,

31
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,580
that somebody else might be
an earlier version of you.

32
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,550
And so leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for
yourself or for

33
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,190
others that'd help to understand
what the code was supposed to do,

34
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:24,140
how it was supposed to work, and
maybe why you made the choices you did.

35
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,140
It can be very helpful, sometimes
that last one is the most important.

36
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,450
It may be that you come up against a case
where this mechanism over here seems like

37
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,040
the right way to do it, and then you find
out it's just not gonna work for some way.

38
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,900
Maybe, recursion is the right way to
do this and then you find out, well,

39
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,660
okay but it's running on hardware
where you can't have more than

40
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,540
six functions calling each other or
you run out of space on your stack.

41
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,190
So okay, fine, we gotta do it differently.

42
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,440
You make choices like that,
you make design decisions.

43
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,810
And leaving those documented for

44
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:05,640
other people later on, can help them
understand why you did what you did.

45
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,770
And to help avoid making mistakes
that maybe you made along the way.

46
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,010
So it's important, do it.

47
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,900
And the best time to get in
the habit of doing it is early on.

48
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,140
Even when you know you're the only
one who is gonna write the code and

49
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,470
you don't expect to look
at it three weeks from now.
