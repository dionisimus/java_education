[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:08,378
In this part of the project you'll be
customizing a map using dynamic data.

3
00:00:08,378 --> 00:00:12,846
So in the next three videos what we'll be
doing is stepping through an example that

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,280
has a similar objective.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,389
So you can see how you might
want to design your thinking for

6
00:00:17,389 --> 00:00:21,150
the next part of the project and
also see how we might do it in practice.

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,440
So by the end of this sequence of videos,
you'll be able to

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,880
approach customizing maps, and
you'll be reading in data files and

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,550
working with the data that
you get from those files.

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,800
And then you'll organize that data using
objects both from the unfolding libraries

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,909
and objects that you define yourself, and

12
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:42,620
we'll be thinking about organizing
data using some abstract data types.

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,320
So let's start by setting up the problem,

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,770
and this example I just
find really striking.

15
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,410
So what we'll be doing is
annotating a map of the world, so

16
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,950
we'll look at all
countries in the world and

17
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,290
we'll be thinking about data for
average life expectancy at birth.

18
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,470
You can think about a person born on
the other side of the world from you,

19
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,980
and as they start off their life journey,

20
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,610
how long might they expect
to have on this world?

21
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,270
So there's data collected by
the World Bank and you can read it in.

22
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,620
And what we've done is annotate
this picture of the world,

23
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,140
this map of the world, so that
the bright red spots are countries where

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,490
the average life expectancy at
birth is somewhere around 45 years.

25
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,460
And the bright blue spots have average
life expectancy around 85 to 90 years.

26
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,614
And so just in this visualization
we see that the range of life

27
00:01:28,614 --> 00:01:30,901
expectancies we find globally.

28
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:34,781
And this is pretty striking, and so by the
end of the videos, you'll be able to do

29
00:01:34,781 --> 00:01:38,664
similar visualizations with all sorts of
data sets that are available online and

30
00:01:38,664 --> 00:01:42,630
in other sources and that we'll also make
available for you through this course.

31
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,830
So the life expectancy data that we
might get, say from the World Bank,

32
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,940
for example, comes to us as a spreadsheet,
comma separated values.

33
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,110
Lots and lots of rows in this file.

34
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,450
And we want to make sense of it,

35
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,010
we want to present it in a way that's
easier to understand and organize.

36
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,350
So when we have a high level
objective like drawing pictures or

37
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,100
visualizing data on a map, it's useful
to break it down into manageable

38
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,500
chunks before we sit down
to program a solution up.

39
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,300
And so for this particular problem, we
can think of our project in three stages.

40
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,090
First, we might setup the map, configure
the window and display the countries.

41
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,730
Then we might go to reading in the data,
and looking at the data file that we have.

42
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,750
And finally we can convert that data
into a visualization on the map.

43
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,165
So the videos will be separated
into these three stages and

44
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:37,450
we'll wrap up this video
by setting up our map.

45
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,140
So this is a good opportunity to think
back to the beginning of your project.

46
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,440
And you've already played around with
similar code where we declare a class, we

47
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:52,060
create a new class, that extends PApplet
and uses the UnfoldingMaps library.

48
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:58,410
So in this class definition we are in
a new file, the LifeExpectancy file.

49
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,660
And remember that the file name
has to match the class name.

50
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,110
And what we're going to
do is create a map and

51
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,980
then we have to define two methods, the
two methods that will setup our applet and

52
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,990
then draw it continuously while
the applet is running to update the view.

53
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,390
Okay, so
let's start by setting up the map and

54
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,990
that first line of code is setting
up the size of the canvas.

55
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,840
We've seen that in a few earlier videos so
hopefully it's familiar at this point.

56
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,830
And then beyond that
we're creating a new map.

57
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:32,810
So we're using the constructor for
the UnfoldingMap, and we're creating a new

58
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,610
map object that we'll be manipulating and
using throughout the project.

59
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,790
All right, this is slightly new and
what we're doing here is using

60
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,200
one of the built-in methods
in the UnfoldingMaps library.

61
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,880
And what this method does is allow

62
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,110
the user to interact with
the map in some limited ways.

63
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:58,720
So by invoking
MapUtils.createDefaultEventDispatcher,

64
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,560
which all seem like magic words at this
point, but if you invoke this little

65
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,510
magic command, What that happens when we
run our applet is that double-clicking

66
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,730
leads to zooming in in the map and we
can do some panning around in the world.

67
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,480
Now, computer science is not magic and

68
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,490
we will make all of this
clear in a future module.

69
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,450
We will talk about event handlers.

70
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,940
We'll talk about what's going
on under the hood, but for

71
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:29,750
now in order to add some added
interactivity, we use this line of code.

72
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,480
Okay, so
we've set up the map a little bit,

73
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,280
we've created a map object and
we've configured its size.

74
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,020
And now if we go ahead into that draw
method, we can call the map's own

75
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,120
draw method, each UnfoldingMap comes with
its own draw method, that will refresh

76
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,160
the screen based on the current objects
and parameters associated with the map.

77
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:56,990
And so at this point what we have is that
default canvas with the map of the globe.

78
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,100
And what we'll do in the next two videos
is start bringing in our data and

79
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,080
shading the countries of the world based
on the life expectancy data that we

80
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,800
talked about earlier.
