2
00:00:03,833 --> 00:00:07,620
So the last lesson we talked a lot
about the processing library, and

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,610
we've had some people ask us hey, is this
a course about processing or about Java?

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,770
What's going on here?

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,730
Why do I need to know all these details
about processing when really I want

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,020
to become a confident
Java software engineer?

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,280
And there's a lot of merit to that.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,570
But what we're hoping that you get
out of this course is how to use

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,930
whichever tools are at your disposal to
come up with a really exciting project or

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,040
product that you want to build.

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,180
And sometimes that means using
libraries like processing.

12
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,730
And that's a good thing.

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,020
So as you use these libraries,
as you develop your code,

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,790
you're not necessarily going to become
an expert in one particular library, but

15
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,910
you want to become proficient and
comfortable enough in figuring

16
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,220
out what pieces of those libraries
are going to be useful for this project.

17
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:59,200
And so what we're doing now is building
on our confidence and comfort level with

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,570
processing so we can apply that
knowledge to building the graphical

19
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,220
application that displays geospatial
data and earthquakes around the world.
