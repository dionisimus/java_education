2
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:08,240
All right, here's your overview
of the last part of the project.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,936
I'm actually only gonna demo part
of the last part of the project,

4
00:00:11,936 --> 00:00:16,700
because the very last part of the project
is an open-ended extension of your choice.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,551
So, you'll get to have some freedom and
some creativity with that.

6
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:22,020
Really, anything goes.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:22,640
It's up to you.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,330
But for the first part of
the project that everybody will do,

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,820
what we are asking you to do is actually
make no changes to the map at all.

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,590
So your map is going to behave
basically just like it did

11
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,510
in the last part of
the programming assignment.

12
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,360
But what you are going to add is,
you are going to add code

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,560
that will sort the earthquakes in
descending order of magnitude.

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,840
So when you run the program now,
in addition to printing out the number of

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,380
earthquakes per country,
they will also print out a list

16
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:58,440
of the earthquakes in the RSP that
you read sorted in reverse order.

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,880
So, strongest magnitude first,
and then a descending order.

18
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,740
And you'll write a function
that allows you to

19
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,960
control the number of earthquakes
that get printed out here.

20
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,370
So that's really it, and then you'll get
to work on that open ended extension, so

21
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,830
have fun with it.

22
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,850
You're gonna get to learn about some
searching and sorting algorithms to write

23
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,310
this part of the project and
then dive into that open ended extension.
