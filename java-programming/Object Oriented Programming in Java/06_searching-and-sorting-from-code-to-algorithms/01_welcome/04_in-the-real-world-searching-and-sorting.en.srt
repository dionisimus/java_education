Hi, my name is Nina Ye.

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,086
I'm on the Google Fiber
software engineering team.

4
00:00:11,086 --> 00:00:17,750
Search and sort are both used very
commonly in the work I do at Google Fiber.

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,140
Actually, don't some people use the word
Google and search interchangeably?

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,000
Let me Google this movie.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,980
Can you Google that recipe?

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,340
On fiber.google.com,
which my team works on,

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,460
one of the most used features by our
users is the check address button.

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,430
It lets our users enter an address and
check whether Google Fiber is coming to or

11
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,410
if it's already available
in that location.

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,380
Once user enters an address,

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,230
the system searches through
an address database of millions and

14
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:55,970
millions of records to find a Google Fiber
readiness status for that entered address.

15
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:00,490
And the result is expected to come back
almost instantaneously to the user.

16
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,010
For that, we need a variable bust and
high performing searching algorithm.

17
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,390
Sorting is used in day
to day programming too.

18
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,830
For instance, to show investors choices
of something in an organized format,

19
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,260
we sort the list before
displaying them to the user.

20
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:22,780
In Google Fiber's sign up web pages,
the sports TV packages, available for

21
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,390
customers to chose from,
are displayed in alphabetical order.
