[MUSIC] So one thing I really struggled with,
when I was learning arrays and sorting algorithms, was array bounds. I was getting exceptions everywhere, I didn't know what to do,
cuz I was getting so many exceptions. And one thing that really helped me was
when I talked to one of my professors. He told me to draw, simply draw the array
and make the numbers and everything. And go through each step of the algorithm,
and doing the sorting, putting the indexes. And it was one thing that after that, I didn't get any array bound exceptions,
and it was perfect.
