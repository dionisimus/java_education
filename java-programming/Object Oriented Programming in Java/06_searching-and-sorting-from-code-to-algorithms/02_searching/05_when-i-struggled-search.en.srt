2
00:00:03,415 --> 00:00:07,477
So one thing I really struggled with,
when I was learning arrays and

3
00:00:07,477 --> 00:00:10,660
sorting algorithms, was array bounds.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,010
I was getting exceptions everywhere,

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:17,350
I didn't know what to do,
cuz I was getting so many exceptions.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,929
And one thing that really helped me was
when I talked to one of my professors.

7
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:30,970
He told me to draw, simply draw the array
and make the numbers and everything.

8
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,240
And go through each step of the algorithm,
and

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,320
doing the sorting, putting the indexes.

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,360
And it was one thing that after that,

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,260
I didn't get any array bound exceptions,
and it was perfect.
