2
00:00:03,539 --> 00:00:05,830
Congratulations on completing our course.

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,030
You've created a large project and
I hope you enjoyed it.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,016
>> Think back to everything
you've learned in this course.

5
00:00:11,016 --> 00:00:12,808
You've learned about object
oriented programming.

6
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:16,212
You've worked with class hierarchies,
inheritance, and polymorphism.

7
00:00:16,212 --> 00:00:19,650
And you've created an interactive
graphical user interface.

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,910
We hope you're really
proud of your project.

9
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,590
>> And we hope you'll join us for
the second course as well.

10
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,050
We'll be thinking about the performance
of the programs that we build.

11
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,590
And we'll be incorporating data structures
as the programs get even more complicated

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,520
and interesting.

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,800
So we hope to see you there.
