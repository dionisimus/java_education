 Review criteria
</h3>
<co-content>
 <p>
  Everyone enrolled in the course must review at least three other submissions to ensure everyone receives a grade; however, many learners complete more to help their peers who are still waiting.

 Assignment
</h3>
<co-content>
 <p>
  Before you can complete this Peer Review assignment, you must
  <strong>
   complete the programming assignment for this module
  </strong>
  , which you can find
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java/supplement/HiLGF/programming-assignment-instructions">
   here
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Next, before you write up your submission, as described below, you might want to
  <strong>
   take a look at the review criteria
  </strong>
  to help you get a sense of what you will be judged on. You can even
  <strong>
   do a few peer reviews in the
   <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java/peer/UG1YU/optional-pre-grading-feedback-on-programming-assignment-extension/give-feedback">
    Optional Pre-grading Feedback Assignment
   </a>
  </strong>
  to see what other people have done.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Finally, follow these instructions:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Run your program with your extension and take a screenshot of your program that clearly shows the extension you implemented. Save your screenshot as a png or jpg format.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    In 3-6 sentences of plain English, describe what functionality your program includes over the basic requirements of the project through module 6? This description should be written so that someone without technical knowledge could understand it.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    In 1-3 paragraphs (3-5 sentences each) or a bulleted list (1-3 sentences per bullet) describe the additions/modifications you made to the code including: additional methods you wrote and/or methods you changed, and (if applicable) any new classes you wrote or changes to the class hierarchy. This description should be technical at the level of a student completing this course, but
    <strong>
     you should not simply copy and paste your code.
    </strong>
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  You should refer to your screenshot in your written explanations when it is helpful.

 Review Criteria
</h3>
<co-content>
 <p>
  This Peer Review assignment will give you a chance to show off your own work as well as see the creativity of your peers. It also gives you the chance to evaluate their work, as well as have your work evaluated by others. This assignment is scored out of 6 points total: 3 points for demonstrating that you completed the extension, and 3 points for your description of the code modifications you made to support it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your final score on this assignment will be the median score you receive from your peers.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this point you are very familiar with your own extension and your own code, but understanding someone else’s technical description of their code can be more challenging. Before you review, you should look at descriptions of your peers in the
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java/peer/UG1YU/optional-pre-grading-feedback-on-programming-assignment-extension/give-feedback">
   Optional Pre-grading Feedback Assignment
  </a>
  .  Do this to get a sense of the range of what these technical descriptions look like, and which are easier or harder to understand. Browsing others’ descriptions is also a great way for you to improve your own technical description before you submit your work.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please note that all open-ended feedback should be given in English and should be constructive and respectful of the work your peers have done.
 </p>
 <p>
  We will ask you to provide feedback to your peers in the following areas:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Project extension (3 points total): Was the project extension above and beyond the requirements for modules 1-6?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Technical explanation (3 points total): How easy was it to understand the modifications to the code based on the submitted technical description?
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
