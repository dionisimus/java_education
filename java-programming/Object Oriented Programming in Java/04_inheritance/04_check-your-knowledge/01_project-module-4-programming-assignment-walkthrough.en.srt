00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,991
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:06,995
As in the previous walk throughs,
it's a good idea to make sure you watch

3
00:00:06,995 --> 00:00:09,227
the overview video before
you walk through this one.

4
00:00:09,227 --> 00:00:10,430
The review video, again,

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,000
gives you the high-level picture of what
is being asked of you for this project.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,471
So let's just dive right
into the write up.

7
00:00:18,471 --> 00:00:21,540
In this programming exam, we're gonna be
adding new features just like we did for

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,128
module three.

9
00:00:22,128 --> 00:00:24,338
It's a good idea to make sure you
read through the learning outcomes,

10
00:00:24,338 --> 00:00:25,280
as well as the introduction.

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,690
Again, just like in the last module,

12
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,210
make sure you have these two
references open when you're working.

13
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,486
So what are you gonna do for
this assignment?

14
00:00:34,486 --> 00:00:37,469
First is you're gonna make sure you
find and open up the starter code.

15
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,267
So here's our starter code for
module four right over here.

16
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:43,903
And you're gonna notice we
have five classes in here.

17
00:00:43,903 --> 00:00:45,527
So that's kind of your first step.

18
00:00:45,527 --> 00:00:46,572
Open up these files and

19
00:00:46,572 --> 00:00:49,602
you may wanna check to see what
the relationship is between them.

20
00:00:49,602 --> 00:00:51,181
So for example, EarthquakeCityMap.

21
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:54,083
It sends p applet,
just like it did before.

22
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:59,003
But you'll notice that city marker
is gonna extend simple point marker

23
00:00:59,003 --> 00:00:59,748
and so on.

24
00:00:59,748 --> 00:01:02,920
It's a good idea to walk through those, so
you can figure out the class hierarchy.

25
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,518
In the next step, you're gonna
want a trace to the store code,

26
00:01:07,518 --> 00:01:09,872
predict what happens when you run it and
then run it.

27
00:01:09,872 --> 00:01:12,972
Now, notice that we've made some changes
to the code from the previous assignment.

28
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:18,452
So you're gonna wanna make sure that
you identify what those changes are.

29
00:01:18,452 --> 00:01:22,281
The next major step is
implement the IsLand method in

30
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:24,639
the EarthquakeCityMap class.

31
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:29,492
So let's go to EarthquakeCityMap,
you scroll down for awhile.

32
00:01:29,492 --> 00:01:34,359
You're gonna find there is
a earthquake surround even more,

33
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:37,178
your gonna find the IsLand method.

34
00:01:37,178 --> 00:01:42,015
The reason we're gonna use this is for
this next step in the assignment,

35
00:01:42,015 --> 00:01:45,030
where you're trying to
figure out whether or

36
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,777
not an earthquake occurred in land or
under the oceans.

37
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:52,478
And if it did occur in the land, you're
going to know what country it occurred in.

38
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,559
And the good news is
we've given you a method,

39
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:59,600
a little bit further
down called IsInCountry.

40
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,265
So this is gonna allow you to essentially
check is my earthquake occurring in this

41
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:06,665
country in the process of checking that,

42
00:02:06,665 --> 00:02:10,936
it's actually gonna set that property
of the country that it's part of.

43
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:13,391
So if it is actually inside that country,

44
00:02:13,391 --> 00:02:17,680
it'll set that earthquake to be
attached essentially to that country.

45
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,177
You'll wanna use that in a future step.

46
00:02:20,177 --> 00:02:25,576
So you wanna use this method IsInCountry

47
00:02:25,576 --> 00:02:29,395
within your IsLand method.

48
00:02:29,395 --> 00:02:34,560
The next step is to implement
your printQuakes method.

49
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,403
The idea for the printQuakes method is
to print out all the earthquakes that

50
00:02:38,403 --> 00:02:42,368
occurred in each country, as long as
there's at least one earthquake in that

51
00:02:42,368 --> 00:02:46,275
country and then also print out how
many earthquakes occurred in the ocean.

52
00:02:46,275 --> 00:02:50,849
You're gonna wanna use that
country property that's

53
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:54,634
attached to earthquakes
to help solve this.

54
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:57,538
The next step after you have coded
these is just like any piece of code,

55
00:02:57,538 --> 00:03:00,113
you're going to test it to make
sure it's working properly.

56
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,679
So the way to test this is we have
given you two tester input files called

57
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:07,911
testonediadem and testtwodiadem and you
can essentially just use those test cases

58
00:03:07,911 --> 00:03:10,630
to make sure you get the right output.

59
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,154
I'm giving you the test1.out.text and

60
00:03:13,154 --> 00:03:18,100
text2.out.text is essentially
the right answers to verify against.

61
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,560
If your printQuake method and

62
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,060
your IsLand method are working properly,
this should work just fine.

63
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,870
Your next step is to draw
a UML class hierarchy.

64
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,205
As I was showing you just before,
you can always look in say,

65
00:03:32,205 --> 00:03:33,660
EarthquakeMarker to figure out.

66
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,130
Go back to your code, look in
EarthquakeMarker and see where it extends.

67
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,360
So this extends a simple point marker.

68
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,160
And we know a simple point marker,

69
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,550
if you look in the documentation
extends for marker.

70
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:50,086
So this is the way you're essentially
going to piece this all together with

71
00:03:50,086 --> 00:03:52,903
the class you'll know
hierarchy looks like.

72
00:03:52,903 --> 00:03:55,515
The next step is to complete
the method definition for

73
00:03:55,515 --> 00:03:57,847
the draw method within
your CityMarker class.

74
00:03:57,847 --> 00:04:00,610
We're gonna wanna add all
of the cities to the map.

75
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,664
So this is essentially
our goal at this point.

76
00:04:02,664 --> 00:04:06,543
And to do this, you're gonna
go into your CityMarker class.

77
00:04:06,543 --> 00:04:08,504
You're gonna find the draw method and

78
00:04:08,504 --> 00:04:11,382
you're gonna find that there's
a big TODO which says,

79
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:15,563
this is where you're gonna want to draw
a triangle to represent the CityMarker.

80
00:04:15,563 --> 00:04:19,784
To draw a triangle and then you have to
think about where is the center location,

81
00:04:19,784 --> 00:04:21,740
which is denoted by this x and this y?

82
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,108
And how will I draw a triangle
essentially around that?

83
00:04:27,022 --> 00:04:31,322
Your next step in the project is gonna
be completing the method definitions for

84
00:04:31,322 --> 00:04:34,059
drawEarthquake in
the LandQuakeMarker class and

85
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:37,520
drawEarthquake in
the OceanQuakeMarker class.

86
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,964
Notice that if you go
into EarthQuakeMarker,

87
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:45,836
there is a drawEarthquake method,
that's an abstract method.

88
00:04:45,836 --> 00:04:49,539
So this is a method that you're gonna have
to override within the derived classes.

89
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,357
So both LandQuakeMarker and

90
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:54,392
OceanQuakeMarker have
to have these methods.

91
00:04:54,392 --> 00:04:57,294
They already have them, but
they're essentially stubs.

92
00:04:57,294 --> 00:04:58,954
They don't do anything yet.

93
00:04:58,954 --> 00:05:02,472
So if you want to drawEarthquakes, you're
gonna add the code to draw a circle,

94
00:05:02,472 --> 00:05:04,376
if you're in the LandQuakeMarker class.

95
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:08,857
For the OceanQuakeMarker class,
you wanna add the code to draw a square.

96
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:14,658
Your next step is going to be
completing the color determine

97
00:05:14,658 --> 00:05:17,112
method within the EarthquakeMarker class.

98
00:05:17,112 --> 00:05:22,417
Let's look real quickly though, at where
that's called and then what it's gonna do.

99
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:26,008
So if we pull-up our code for
EarthquakeMarker,

100
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:28,152
we have a method called draw.

101
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:30,121
So this is what the EarthquakeMarker
is gonna look like and

102
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,252
it essentially does a few steps.

103
00:05:31,252 --> 00:05:34,332
It's going to call this
colorDetermine method,

104
00:05:34,332 --> 00:05:37,058
which we know we have to write for
this step.

105
00:05:37,058 --> 00:05:39,460
And then it calls it drawEarthquake
method, which we wrote for

106
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,240
the previous step.

107
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,270
So let's look in
the colorDetermine method.

108
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,241
Within the colorDetermine method,
we don't have any code yet.

109
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:53,302
So what we wanna do here is figure out
whether or not it should be red, blue or

110
00:05:53,302 --> 00:05:57,634
yellow and these are the colors we suggest
based on the depth of the earthquake.

111
00:05:57,634 --> 00:06:00,673
If you're curious to figure
out how to figure out depth,

112
00:06:00,673 --> 00:06:04,855
notice there's a bunch of helper methods
within EarthquakeMarker class that

113
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:09,058
are gonna be useful to you from getting
the magnitude, to getting the depths.

114
00:06:09,058 --> 00:06:12,193
Now we're gonna talk real quickly
about why we laid this out this way?

115
00:06:12,193 --> 00:06:16,108
So you have your draw method
in the EarthquakeMarker class,

116
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:20,958
which is the parent class of both
LandQuakeMarker and OceanQuakeMarker.

117
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:25,275
Because you're gonna mark and determine
the color to be red, green or blue

118
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:30,278
regardless of whether or not, it's a Land
or an OceanQuakeMarker, it actually makes

119
00:06:30,278 --> 00:06:35,090
sense to put this color determination call
in the parent class and define it there.

120
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,076
If you try to put it in the subclasses,
LandQuakeMarker or OceanQuakeMarker,

121
00:06:41,076 --> 00:06:44,539
you just write the same code twice and
that doesn't make any sense.

122
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:45,641
Back to our steps.

123
00:06:45,641 --> 00:06:47,476
We are almost done at this point.

124
00:06:47,476 --> 00:06:50,199
If you want,
you can add this extra feature,

125
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,081
which is a check to see if
the earthquake has occurred recently.

126
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:57,518
And if it has, then you will
want to draw these kind of Xs.

127
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:01,999
And the place you will wanna do that
is actually, we scrolled right past it.

128
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:06,075
If you wanna check to see right here,
right after drawEarthquake, whether or

129
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:07,944
not it's occurred in the last day.

130
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:11,230
If it has occurred within the past day,
you'll wanna put an X.

131
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,447
I hope these steps help you get started.

132
00:07:13,447 --> 00:07:17,080
As always with these projects, you'll
wanna work through this step by step.

133
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,030
So go right back up to step one and
start working through.

134
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:24,097
You wanna read this fairly carefully,
because we've tried to give you

135
00:07:24,097 --> 00:07:28,387
the necessary details to solve that
part of the problem in text right here.

136
00:07:28,387 --> 00:07:31,607
If you do run into problems though,
feel free to review the videos,

137
00:07:31,607 --> 00:07:32,521
check the forums.

138
00:07:32,521 --> 00:07:34,310
And again, try to have fun.
