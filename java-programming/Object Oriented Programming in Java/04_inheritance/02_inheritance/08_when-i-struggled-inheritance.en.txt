[MUSIC] So when I was working on a really
large project in graduate school, I hit this point where I was
changing all of my code and I knew the right thing to
do was to do inheritance. I was basically making three objects, but I was a little bit lazy with
the software infrastructure. I was like you know what,
I'm just gonna do this in one class. I can make this work. And it worked for little while. So I worked on it for a few weeks,
got the code working. But over the next couple of months, I kept running into bug after bug
after bug related to this code. And finally one day I had to go to
a group meeting for a research group and say, I'm gonna need to take two weeks and
rewrite the code properly. I did. I lost two weeks of my life doing it, but
it worked out after that, no more bugs. So I learned inheritance the hard way.
