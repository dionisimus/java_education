00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,332
For example, I work with Google Docs, and

3
00:00:09,332 --> 00:00:14,135
what we do is we'll use a base class for
representing format buttons.

4
00:00:14,135 --> 00:00:20,925
So every button has a specific style,
an image, an action that the button does.

5
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:25,474
And we'll use that and we'll extend it
to make things like the bold button,

6
00:00:25,474 --> 00:00:28,605
the italic button, the underline button.

7
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:34,190
Another example of Google APIs that use

8
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:40,030
inheritance is actually found in Android,
where we will extend the Activity class.

9
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:45,050
So an activity is a single focused thing
that the user can do within an app.

10
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,283
And an app can be made of
several activities and

11
00:00:47,283 --> 00:00:51,410
we use an inheritance to
prevent us from repeating code.
