2
00:00:03,992 --> 00:00:07,825
So when I was working on a really
large project in graduate school,

3
00:00:07,825 --> 00:00:10,835
I hit this point where I was
changing all of my code and

4
00:00:10,835 --> 00:00:13,720
I knew the right thing to
do was to do inheritance.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,521
I was basically making three objects, but

6
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:17,980
I was a little bit lazy with
the software infrastructure.

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,595
I was like you know what,
I'm just gonna do this in one class.

8
00:00:19,595 --> 00:00:20,870
I can make this work.

9
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,750
And it worked for little while.

10
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,490
So I worked on it for a few weeks,
got the code working.

11
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,340
But over the next couple of months,

12
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,050
I kept running into bug after bug
after bug related to this code.

13
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,400
And finally one day I had to go to
a group meeting for a research group and

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,570
say, I'm gonna need to take two weeks and
rewrite the code properly.

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,910
I did.

16
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,690
I lost two weeks of my life doing it, but
it worked out after that, no more bugs.

17
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,300
So I learned inheritance the hard way.
