2
00:00:04,039 --> 00:00:08,980
So one of the problems I had when learning
about inheritance is relationship.

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,188
And my professor used some analogy
along the lines of animals, and

4
00:00:12,188 --> 00:00:13,401
like a lion is an animal.

5
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:15,748
And for whatever reason that
went right over my head and

6
00:00:15,748 --> 00:00:19,080
it really frustrated me because I felt
like all my peers quickly picked it up.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,810
And so
I reached out to my professor after class.

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,750
And, he just twisted
the analogy to be cars.

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,526
And he asked me what kinda car I drove,
and I answered, I drove a Toyota.

10
00:00:28,526 --> 00:00:32,600
And he just relayed that same analogy,
but back to cars and Toyotas.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,952
And he said, a Toyota is a car,
but not all cars are Toyotas.

12
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:39,420
And for whatever reason, that really
clicked with me, and that's what it took.
