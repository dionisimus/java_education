[MUSIC] For example, I work with Google Docs, and what we do is we'll use a base class for
representing format buttons. So every button has a specific style,
an image, an action that the button does. And we'll use that and we'll extend it
to make things like the bold button, the italic button, the underline button. Another example of Google APIs that use inheritance is actually found in Android,
where we will extend the Activity class. So an activity is a single focused thing
that the user can do within an app. And an app can be made of
several activities and we use an inheritance to
prevent us from repeating code.
