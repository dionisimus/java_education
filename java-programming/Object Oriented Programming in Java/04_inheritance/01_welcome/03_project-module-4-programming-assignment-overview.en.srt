2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:05,526
In the project for this module,

3
00:00:05,526 --> 00:00:09,740
we'll be going further with our graphing
of earthquakes onto the world map.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,890
The past assignment was really neat.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,900
You displayed earthquakes on a map, and

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,940
had their appearance determined by
the magnitude of the earthquake.

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,570
But knowing the magnitude of
the earthquake alone, isn't really enough

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,110
information to understand
the potential impact of that event.

9
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,445
So we'll be going further with
this idea in this module by making

10
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:29,522
the earthquakes appear differently based
on the location of the earthquake,

11
00:00:29,522 --> 00:00:33,310
the depth of the earthquake, and
optionally the age of the earthquake.

12
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,978
But we'll continue to visualize the
magnitude of the earthquake as the size

13
00:00:36,978 --> 00:00:37,733
of the marker.

14
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:40,229
So there's a number of steps
to this assignment, but

15
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:42,677
let's try to break it down
to four high level goals.

16
00:00:42,677 --> 00:00:45,910
The first goal is to add markers for
major cities.

17
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,260
If you don't see your city here,
please feel free to add it.

18
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,740
The second is to figure out if
the earthquakes occurred in the land, and

19
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,320
if so, occurred in which country.

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,570
Then, you want to draw the earthquakes
differently if they occurred in the land

21
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,920
or in the sea.

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,370
And you'll again change the size of
the earthquake, based on its magnitude.

23
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,370
Now, where earthquakes occur matters.

24
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,020
As the threat they pose is affected by
whether or not they're under water and

25
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,490
could cause a tsunami.

26
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,710
Or if they're on land and could cause
physical damage to surrounding areas.

27
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,340
The third goal is to change
the color of the marker

28
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,570
based on how deep the earthquake occurred.

29
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,890
Again, the depth of the earthquake changes
its potential impact to surrounding areas.

30
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,830
Lastly, as an optional goal,

31
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,260
you can add an X to the earthquakes,
which occurred in the past day.

32
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,790
To accomplish these goals we are using
features of both inheritance and

33
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,550
polymorphism in Java.

34
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,330
So be sure to check out the videos on
these topics if you are unfamiliar or

35
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,080
uncomfortable with those ideas.

36
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,920
This is one of my favorite
parts of the project.

37
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,740
I hope you'll enjoy it too.
