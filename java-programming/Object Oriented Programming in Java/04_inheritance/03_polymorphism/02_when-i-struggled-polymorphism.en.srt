Hello, I'm Ken.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,330
One time when I struggled during
a program assignment was with,

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,810
it was based on polymorphism and
inheritance.

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:19,140
What you had to do was create
classes of different animals and

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,996
connect them through inheritance and
polymorphism.

7
00:00:21,996 --> 00:00:25,520
And what was hard about it when
I first opened the assignment,

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,650
it was just a blank screen, a blank
text editor, and I was overwhelmed.

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,030
I didn't know where to start.

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,560
What really helped was
the online posting and

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:39,290
everyone conversating on Piazza and
that forum.

12
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:45,210
What also helped was just really stepping
away from it just a little bit and

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,110
giving it some time just because I was so
overwhelmed by it at that moment,

14
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,060
just really calming down and
taking a break from the material.

15
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,659
And then revisiting it allowed me to,
I think, get it done.
