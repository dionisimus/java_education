[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:11,477
So one of the ways that Google is
able to tell some new application or

3
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:16,430
a service that you have successfully
logged in, is by issuing tokens.

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,400
And there are many different
reasons that an application or

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,380
website can ask for tokens.

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,500
From an identity provider like Google.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,630
But when we started out,
they were far fewer.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,260
And the different flows that determine
what kind of token you will get back

9
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:36,480
are determined by say
a parameter called grant type.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,670
So I can ask for
a token with a grant type device or

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,660
with a grant type access token or
with a grant type code.

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,520
Or the grant type assertion.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,890
Now as the years grew on, we got more and

14
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,040
more grant types that we
added to this same endpoint.

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,120
So whenever someone goes to
Googleapis.com/33/token and asks for

16
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:04,580
a particular grant type, they all make
a call to the same class in our code base.

17
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,130
Now obviously over the past two years,

18
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,840
that particular class has grown really,
really large.

19
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,000
But there is a lot of similarities between
each of the different grant types or

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,320
what needs to be done.

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,670
The overall processing of the request,
the validation

22
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,450
of the various other parameters
that are sent in to the request.

23
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,410
And the eventual creation of a response
that needs to be sent back to the user,

24
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,370
all of which will always contain a token.

25
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:36,420
So it's possible to pull out each
of these aspects, or to pull

26
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,550
out each of these into a separate method,
and put them into an abstract class.

27
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,540
So that each grant type can
be processed separately, and

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,810
they all get to do the same thing,
which is to create a token response.

29
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,530
And that's my project for this quarter,
and essentially that's inheritance.
