[MUSIC] Congratulations on completing
the first week of the course. We're going to continue
right where you left off and we'll start diving into memory models and
scope. Again, this may be a review for
some of you. If you feel like it's
too much of a review, feel free to skip ahead to
the graded quiz at the end of scope. After completing scope, you can get
started with the programming project and you'll build your first application and
folding maps.
