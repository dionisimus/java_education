00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:10,060
Congratulations on completing
the first week of the course.

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,030
We're going to continue
right where you left off and

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,980
we'll start diving into memory models and
scope.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,870
Again, this may be a review for
some of you.

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,410
If you feel like it's
too much of a review,

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,640
feel free to skip ahead to
the graded quiz at the end of scope.

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,009
After completing scope, you can get
started with the programming project and

9
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:28,349
you'll build your first application and
folding maps.
