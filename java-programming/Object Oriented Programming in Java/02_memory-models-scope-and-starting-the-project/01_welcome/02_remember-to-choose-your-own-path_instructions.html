  Remember there are many paths you can take through the different videos:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    The
    <strong>
     Core
    </strong>
    videos introduce the basic material.  If you learn well from lectures alone, then watching only these videos might work for you.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The
    <strong>
     Concept Challenge
    </strong>
    videos test your learning of material you just watched.  These videos will give you practice to make sure youâ€™re prepared for the quizzes and the programming assignments.  Most learners will find them helpful in addition to the Core video series.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The
    <strong>
     Support
    </strong>
    series videos give you a little extra practice and guidance when you feel you need it.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Finally, the
    <strong>
     In the Real World
    </strong>
    , and
    <strong>
     When I Struggled
    </strong>
    video series relate the concepts and skills you are learning to real-life experiences and situations.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Play around with watching and/or skipping the different video types until you find a combination of that works best for your learning.
