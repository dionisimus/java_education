00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,819
[NOISE] What we get to do in this
video is take the concepts that you

2
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:09,251
talked about with Christine and
apply them in an example so

3
00:00:09,251 --> 00:00:15,147
we can really work through them together
and see how they help us step by step.

4
00:00:15,147 --> 00:00:18,035
So the key concept that we're
gonna be developing and

5
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:20,980
thinking about here is
that of memory models.

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,210
And we're going to see how they apply for

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,820
this code snippet that
we'll trace through now.

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,700
So let's think about what happens
in the first line of code.

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,990
First things first.

10
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,928
And in this first line of code,
we both have a variable being declared and

11
00:00:33,928 --> 00:00:36,880
then a value being
assigned to that variable.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,560
So in our memory model,
whenever we have a new variable,

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,612
we want to denote that by writing
the name of that variable.

14
00:00:42,612 --> 00:00:47,060
[BLANK AUDIO] And

15
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,970
then drawing a box where we'll
record the value of the variable.

16
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:52,660
Okay.

17
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:59,120
So we've drawn Var1, we've drawn that in
our memory model, we've got a box for it.

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,750
And the value that's being assigned is
the right hand side of the equals over

19
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,680
there which is 17.

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,000
And so we put that in the box, cool.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,830
Now we can move onto the second line, and

22
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,540
in the second line while we're
declaring a new variable.

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,410
So we have to update our memory model
which means that we need to write Var2,

24
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,970
our new variable that we just declared and
give it a box as well.

25
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,140
And now we think about what
goes into this box and

26
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,210
we look at the right hand side
of the assignment statement.

27
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,520
And the right hand side of the assignment
statement says we want the value

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,590
of var1 + 1.

29
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,540
But the value of var1 is
recorded in our handy

30
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,090
memory model right over here, it's 17.

31
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:48,220
And so we add 1 to that, and the new
value of var2 is 17 plus 1, which is 18.

32
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,320
Cool, okay, two lines done.

33
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,440
We go into the next line, and

34
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,040
the next line is now just
a pure assignment statement.

35
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,180
And what we want to remember is that for
this assignment statement,

36
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,620
we're taking the value on the right
hand side of the assignment statement.

37
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,430
And what we'd like to do is assign that

38
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:13,780
to be the new value of the variable
on the left hand side.

39
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,570
Okay, so on the right hand side,
over here, we've got var2 + 1.

40
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,130
And so
we could look at our memory model for

41
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,220
the current value of var2, which is 18.

42
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:29,300
And so the value that's on the right
hand side here is 18 + 1, or 19.

43
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:34,900
So that's whats over here, this value.

44
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,030
And what we do is we take this value and
we copy it into the box for var1.

45
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,530
That means that var1's
new value Is that 19.

46
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,800
Okay, and
now we get to display our results,

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,300
we get to display what
we've done by printing out.

48
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,300
So we've got
the system.out.println command and

49
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:58,630
what we're writing here is var1: and

50
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,530
then the value of var1 which we
read off our memory model and

51
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,740
then we've got a comma, a space, var2.

52
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,700
And then, I'm running off the screen but
I'm gonna put the next

53
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,180
value right over here and that's the value
that we can read off of var2, 18.

54
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:21,029
And we're done, yey.
