2
00:00:03,918 --> 00:00:05,949
All right.
Something I struggled with when I

3
00:00:05,949 --> 00:00:10,356
was learning computer science, and also
I still really kind of struggle with it

4
00:00:10,356 --> 00:00:14,635
today, is just simply compiling and
running and testing my code.

5
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:17,465
I'm not really sure why, but
when I started out programming

6
00:00:17,465 --> 00:00:21,285
I was just terrified to compile, and
I was terrified to run because I was so

7
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:23,705
afraid of the errors that
were going to be in my code.

8
00:00:23,705 --> 00:00:28,945
And, of course, we all have errors in our
code, but it just, it was a visceral fear.

9
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:32,165
And I always thought, oh, my God, like the
computer is going to explode or something,

10
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,383
and I would just not do it.

11
00:00:33,383 --> 00:00:36,150
So it would lead me to write
these huge methods and

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,970
these huge programs before I compiled or
ran anything, and it was a big mistake.

13
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,430
So I got over that just by
kind of practicing more,

14
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,660
hitting the compile button and the run
button and realizing that nothing happens.

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,700
Your code breaks and you fix it and
it's not a big deal.

16
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,080
So that's what I've learned, but,
you know, it's still kind of scary for

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,740
me sometimes.
