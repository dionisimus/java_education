2
00:00:04,628 --> 00:00:07,602
Congratulations on getting Java,
Eclipse, and

3
00:00:07,602 --> 00:00:09,880
[INAUDIBLE] maps set up on your system.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,850
Set up is actually one of the biggest
barriers to getting started with this

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:14,660
course.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,960
So now that you've gotten that done we can
start diving into the program projects.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,020
Which we hope will be more fun.

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,600
The role of these videos is, first,
to give you an idea of what's required for

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,070
the project and, secondly, to give you
some hints about where you should look at

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,960
in the code to help solve the problem.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,370
So this video is really a high-level
view of the programming assignment,

12
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,970
along with some tips.

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,580
If you want the full
details of the assignment,

14
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,140
you can always go to the Reading
on the Programming Assignment.

15
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,910
So for let's dive into the code.

16
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,270
So if you got un fully
maps that are properly,

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,220
you should have have package
here which is UCSDUnfoldingMaps.

18
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,100
And let's start by spanning that.

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,910
So, span it going to the source,
module1 is for

20
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,830
this programming project Going to
module 1, you'll find HelloWorld.

21
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,080
If you open that you'll
find this file here.

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,320
Now it's always a good idea,
when starting with a new file,

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,730
to figure out what the high
level structure is.

24
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,360
So we know what the class name is,
this is HelloWorld.

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,370
It's extending PApplet.

26
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,100
We're going to dive into some details
about what extends means later in

27
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:17,930
this course.

28
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,530
But for right now this means that this is
going to be a graphical user interface.

29
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,400
And it has two methods that
we're going to care about.

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,890
So if you scroll down,
you'll find the setup method.

31
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,470
Setup is called once, and
it sets up everything within the frame.

32
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,040
And then the other method that
we're going to focus on is draw.

33
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,350
Now draw is called repeatedly.

34
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,990
So now that we have an overview of
the structure, that there's a setup and

35
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,040
a draw method.

36
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,170
Let's try running an application and
see what it looks like.

37
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,531
So Go under here, do Run As > Java Applet.

38
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:55,462
And what we get is an application that
has a background with a map on it, and

39
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:58,230
this map is zoomed in to California.

40
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,290
It already has some built-in
functionality, in that you can zoom in or

41
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,150
zoom out if you wish.

42
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,990
And what's missing from this right now,
is a second map,

43
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:13,750
which should go here, which is going to
be zoomed in to your hometown.

44
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,680
So that's the main thing you have to do
with this assignment is create the second

45
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,090
map that's zoomed in to your hometown.

46
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,110
And we'll do is we'll start looking at the
code that might help you accomplish this.

47
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,750
So the main thing to focus on is
where was that first map created.

48
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,990
So if you go into your code,
what you'll find are,

49
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,860
we have two maps that are created,
map1 and map2.

50
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,490
And before I dive into the details
of those I do want to mention.

51
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,220
If you are working offline, you'll
want to change this variable to be true.

52
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,360
All right, back to our maps.

53
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,010
So we have two maps,
an unfolding map1 and an unfolding map2.

54
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,160
And what we've set up is map one for you.

55
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,540
But we haven't set up map two yet.

56
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,080
We create the application
just as we do here,

57
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,050
which is using the size method which
creates an 800 x 600 size map.

58
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,250
And then we set the background.

59
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,400
If you want to change the background
color you can play with that here.

60
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,410
And then we use our map provider.

61
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,820
Which here we are using Google.

62
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,200
We have some code which only
applies if you're offline,

63
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,160
and then you can find out here
finally our first use of Map1.

64
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,920
Here we're creating a new unfolding map,
here's our x, our y, our width, and

65
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,420
our size, and we're using this Google Map
provider to creat this unfolding map.

66
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,330
Now you want to use something
just like this for your solution.

67
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,910
And notice that, then, right after
we create the map, we then zoom and

68
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,050
pan to a location.

69
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,610
And this location happens to
be the location of UCSD, but

70
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,220
you'll want to put in the location
of your hometown here.

71
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,730
The next step is to see if
map1 is used anywhere else.

72
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,030
And it turns out map1 is
shown in the draw method.

73
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,340
So as long as you do the draw method.

74
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:56,430
And if you call map1.draw within
the draw method map 1 draws.

75
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,950
You want to do something
similar with map 2.

76
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,300
So I hope at this point you have a pretty
good feel of what you're going to do.

77
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,910
So you're going to focus
on setting up a map 2 in

78
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,120
the right location in the application.

79
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,050
And then you're going to
zoom in to your hometown.

80
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,046
And then you're going to make sure that
map2 is drawing every time this draw

81
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:15,927
method gets called.

82
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,658
After completing your assignment,
your next step will be to just take

83
00:04:21,658 --> 00:04:25,080
the Programming Assignment quiz
at the end of this module.

84
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,230
So you will not being sending any code for
any of the assignments within this course.

85
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,490
Instead, you'll be taking
the end of module quizzes,

86
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,430
which will test you on the concepts
both in the module but

87
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,930
also on ideas related to
the programming assignment.

88
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,240
So before take the end of
week required quizzes,

89
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,240
make sure you do the programming
assignments first.
