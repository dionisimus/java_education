1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:07,163
[SOUND] So
you've now heard a lot about objects.

2
00:00:07,163 --> 00:00:08,620
You've heard a lot about memory models.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,180
You've heard a lot about scope.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,050
You've worked through
some concept challenges.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,220
And, now we have an opportunity
to put it all together.

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:20,040
So, buckle in, get ready,
this is gonna be a tricky example, but

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,740
we're gonna get through it together.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,490
So what we're going to do here is
take the simple location class that

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,040
you've talked about a lot with Christine
and we're going to change it a bit.

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,870
So remember the simple location we
want to encode the latitude and

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,420
the longitude and so far we've been
encoding them as two instance variables,

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,070
each of them is a number type
of primitive type double.

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,420
But now we're going to twist things up
a bit and we're gonna define a new class,

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,380
a different class, called a ray location.

15
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,910
And we're still going to want to record
the coordinates of that location,

16
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,450
but we're gonna try to implement
this by recording them in an array.

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,660
So it's an array that
were called quarts and

18
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,102
the kind of information that's stored in
that array are still gonna be doubles.

19
00:01:05,102 --> 00:01:10,180
All right, so, let's think about how we
might define this class ArrayLocation and

20
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,290
then try to use it in the main method.

21
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:17,590
Okay, so, for our class definition
we defined the instance variable

22
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,400
coords of type array that's
going to contain doubles.

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,320
And then we're going to need
to define the constructor.

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,710
And the constructor when it receives
a parameter that's specifying an array

25
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:36,000
that indicates the coordinates,
we're going to say this.coords = coords.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,940
That's going to be the definition
of our constructor.

27
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,727
And then we might go ahead and
want to try to use these objects.

28
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:47,986
And so in our main method you can
imagine a situation where we start

29
00:01:47,986 --> 00:01:53,736
us off by defining a new array and
initializing it to 5.0 and 0.0.

30
00:01:53,736 --> 00:01:55,107
And if you'll look on a map,

31
00:01:55,107 --> 00:01:58,550
you'll see that those are roughly
the coordinates of accra in Africa.

32
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,040
And so then we might want to create
a location and label the variable that's

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,060
pointing to that object, that array
location object, call it accra and say.

34
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,600
That variable accra is going to
point to a new array location

35
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,990
with the coordinates as specified
in that previous array.

36
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,240
And then we might want to go ahead and
get ready to think about

37
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,000
a different location and so
we might want to use our coords array and

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,610
store the value 32.9 in the zeroth
index and -117.2 in the index 1.

39
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,330
And if you recognize those, those
are the coordinates for UC San Diego.

40
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,420
And then, oh just to check that we haven't
messed anything up, we might debug

41
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,790
our code by printing out the coordinates
pointed to by the accra variable.

42
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,660
And so what I'd like to do now
is pause and I want you to

43
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,590
first of all think through what you
think will happen when we do this.

44
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,760
And second of all, open up Eclipse,

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,105
type in this code, remember that you're
file name is going to have to be

46
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:05,360
ArrayLocation.java to
match with the class name.

47
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,540
And see what happens and
see if you can explain what happens.

48
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,680
And when we come back together,
we'll work through the memory models and

49
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,740
figure out together what happens and why.
