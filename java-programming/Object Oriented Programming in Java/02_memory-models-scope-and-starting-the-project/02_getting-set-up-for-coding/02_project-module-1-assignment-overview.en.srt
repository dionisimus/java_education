2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,007
The programming assignment for the first
course module is really aimed at just

3
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:10,920
getting us up to speed and
running with Unfolding Maps.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,770
I know that many of you are eager to get
programming, but before we can get there,

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,180
you're gonna have to get Unfolding Maps
set up and running in Eclipse first.

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,510
So please follow through our texts and

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,240
our video guides to helping setting up,
help setup Unfolding Maps for your system,

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,250
and then turn to the forums
if you run into problems.

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,200
Before we get there,
what I wanted to show you is an example

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,010
of a finished programming assignment for
this first module.

11
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,880
We'll give you the code to create the map
on the left, which is centered on us,

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,640
here at UC San Diego.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,570
Specifically, we're
really right about here.

14
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,890
Notice that on this map I'm
able to zoom in and out.

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,780
So zoomed out, I'm able to zoom in.

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,440
I'm able to zoom in toward UC San Diego.

17
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,740
And we're really right over here.

18
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,520
Now being able to zoom like
this is pretty amazing.

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,488
A lot of work goes into making
something like that happen,

20
00:01:01,488 --> 00:01:05,487
including getting the map data from
Google Maps, so the handling of my mouse,

21
00:01:05,487 --> 00:01:06,653
scrolling in and out.

22
00:01:06,653 --> 00:01:10,962
These amazing features are really just
part of the libraries and Unfolding Maps

23
00:01:10,962 --> 00:01:15,221
and processing, which is why we're
using these libraries for this project.

24
00:01:15,221 --> 00:01:17,288
All right, back to our assignment.

25
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:21,645
We're gonna give you the code
to produce the map on the left,

26
00:01:21,645 --> 00:01:24,950
which is zoomed into San Diego.

27
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,450
What we want you to do is to
create the map on the right,

28
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,070
which we zoomed in to where you live.

29
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,050
Now I live in San Diego these days, but

30
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,960
I grew up in Pullman, Washington, which
is on the east side of Washington State,

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,610
and Washington state's on
the West Coast of the United States.

32
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,620
So this is really just
a small program assignment,

33
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,370
just to get started with Unfolding Maps.

34
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,245
The big step is really just scanning
Unfolding Maps and working on your system.

35
00:01:48,245 --> 00:01:52,765
So select the right video guide for
installing Unfolding Maps, Java,

36
00:01:52,765 --> 00:01:55,845
and Eclipse on your personal system.

37
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:58,595
And I'll see you again for
the assignment walkthrough.
