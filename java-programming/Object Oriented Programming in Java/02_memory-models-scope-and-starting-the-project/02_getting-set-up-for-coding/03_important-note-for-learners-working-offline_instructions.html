  Important note for learners working offline
 </h1>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  All of the programming assignments in this course (including the assignment for this lesson) work better when you develop them while connected with an active internet connection.   The internet connection is used to download live map information ("tiles" or small pieces of the map) from map providers.  (See more details here:
  <a href="http://unfoldingmaps.org/tutorials/mapprovider-and-tiles.html#">
   http://unfoldingmaps.org/tutorials/mapprovider-and-tiles.html#
  </a>
  )  The default starter code for all the assignments assumes that you are working with an active internet connection.  If you are not connected to the Internet, and you try to run the starter code we provide without modification, you will get a very nasty looking error that looks something like:
 </p>
 <p>
  “The file "http://mt1.google.com/vt/v=w2p.116&amp;hl=de&amp;x=3&amp;y=1&amp;z=3&amp;s=Galileo" is missing or inaccessible, make sure the URL is valid or that the file has been added to your sketch and is readable.”
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  However, some of you may need to work offline.  To accommodate this, we provide special notes in each of the programming assignments for modifying the starter code to use the offline version of the map that is included with the Unfolding Maps library.  This offline map is less detailed (it only has three zoom levels) and so the application you build with it will also be somewhat more limited.  However, you will still be able to get things working and do all the pieces of this assignment even if you do not have internet connectivity.  You can always switch back to the online version when you get your internet connection back.
