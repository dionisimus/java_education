  Ready, set, code!
 </h1>
 <p>
  Before we dive into memory models and scope, we're going to introduce the piece of the project you'll be working on this week, and help you get your system set up to run code. We encourage you to run the examples we provide in the videos this week.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this course, we use Eclipse as our recommended development environment.  If you've never used Eclipse before, that's fine.  It can be a little complicated at first, but once you get going with it, it's very powerful.  We provide instructions on how to set up and run your code, and if you get stuck or need help, you can look around in the discussion forums, or post to get help from the mentors or from other learners.
 </p>
 <p>
  Coding is the fun part, but it can also be frustrating at times.  Hang in there and we hope you have fun!
