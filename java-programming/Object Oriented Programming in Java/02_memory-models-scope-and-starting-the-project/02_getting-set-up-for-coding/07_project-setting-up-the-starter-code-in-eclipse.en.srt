[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:07,378
In this video, we're going to show
you how to get the starter code for

3
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:10,030
the project and get it set up in Eclipse.

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:14,270
So you've probably already found this
setup document which is week one,

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,920
getting started with the project.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,350
It's talking about how to setup
a Java Eclipse and the starter code.

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,310
And I'm going to assume that
you've completed part one,

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,910
which is setup Eclipse and Java.

9
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,990
And we're going to jump down to Part 2.

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,090
So about halfway down the document,
this is the part that we'll be going over,

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,130
getting and setting up the starter code.

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,600
So you can download the starter
code from this link here and

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,470
what you want to do is download it and
unzip it somewhere on your system.

14
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,840
And the only restriction is we want you to
put at somewhere that is not inside your

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,090
Eclipse workspace folder.

16
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,870
So, once you've downloaded and
unzipped the code,

17
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,250
you'll go over here into Eclipse,
and you should see a blank

18
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,370
workspace if you haven't done
any other coding yet in Eclipse.

19
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,795
So, what you'll want to do is
to get the starter code set up,

20
00:00:58,795 --> 00:01:00,370
you go to the File menu and

21
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:04,180
then in the File menu, you'll click
Import and that'll open up a new window.

22
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,113
And what we want to do is we
want to import an existing project

23
00:01:07,113 --> 00:01:08,220
into our workspace.

24
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,320
So that's under General, so I expand the
General tab if it's not opened already,

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,973
then I'm going to click on
ExistingProjects into WorkSpace,

26
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:16,880
click Next.

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,442
And then what I have to do is tell Eclipse
where to find the code that I want to

28
00:01:20,442 --> 00:01:21,020
import.

29
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,048
So I go over here and I browse and

30
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:28,042
then I'm going to browse back to where
I saved and unzipped that starter code.

31
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:32,962
And I just put it on my desktop, so
I'll go up here and find my desktop and

32
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:35,700
here it is down here at the bottom.

33
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,110
So I select the UCSDUnfoldingMaps
directory, and then I click OK.

34
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:46,540
And you can see that it
imported this project or

35
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,460
it gave me the option to import
this product in this window here.

36
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,950
So the only other really important
thing that you need to do is

37
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,870
make sure that this Copy projects
into workspace option is selected.

38
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,710
We actually want to copy the files,
the source code and

39
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:05,070
everything else, from wherever we
saved it into our workspace directory.

40
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,710
So just make sure that's checked,
and then you click Finish.

41
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,410
And then what you're going
to see is that our code and

42
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:17,090
everything else has been successfully
imported into our workspace.

43
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,760
So you can see that now I have
the starter code, if I expand it out,

44
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,610
you can see that there's a whole bunch
of files associated with this project.

45
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,610
And if I open up the source code,
I can see this divided into

46
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,970
these organizational modules
basically called packages.

47
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,240
So there's one package for every module
that has a programming assignment.

48
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,920
So module1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 and
that's where you'll find a starter code.

49
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,890
So here we can see the starter code for
module1 in a file called HelloWorld.java.

50
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:50,670
And I can open by double clicking on
it and I can even run this starter code

51
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,760
by clicking this button here and
selecting Run As Java Applet.

52
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,680
You might have multiple choices there,
if you do, just select Java Applet.

53
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,410
I won't run it right now, because I
don't want to give away what it does.

54
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,080
I'll let you wait until you start on a
project to figure out what that does, but

55
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,760
that's how you would run it.

56
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,100
And then the other thing to notice is
that there's this package called Demos.

57
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,570
And if you look at that,
that's going to have a bunch of

58
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,100
demos that we're going to be working with
throughout the course in the videos.

59
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,330
So if you want to run some of the code
that we talk about in the videos,

60
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,740
look here in this Demos folder.

61
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,060
We don't have all of it here,
but we do have some of it, so

62
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,890
you might find it here.

63
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,460
All right, and for
the last thing I want to tell you about

64
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,195
is where do you actually find all
of these files on your file system.

65
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:38,980
So remember when we checked that
Import into workspace button,

66
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,015
that option when we
imported the whole package?

67
00:03:42,015 --> 00:03:46,395
Well what that did was it actually copied
all of our files into our workspace.

68
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:50,565
So if you go over here into our file

69
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:55,707
finder you can see that this folder here,
UCSDUnfoldingMaps,

70
00:03:55,707 --> 00:03:59,967
that's where we can find all the actual
files associated with our project.

71
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:02,097
And you can see here in
the source folder and

72
00:04:02,097 --> 00:04:06,747
for example module1, this is where
my actual .java file resides.

73
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,577
But you'll be editing it through Eclipse,
but

74
00:04:08,577 --> 00:04:11,527
if you want to know where it actually is,
here it is.

75
00:04:11,527 --> 00:04:14,467
Okay, now you're all set up and
ready to go, so have fun with the project.
