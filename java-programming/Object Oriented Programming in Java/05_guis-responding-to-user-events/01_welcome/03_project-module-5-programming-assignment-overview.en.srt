[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04,363 --> 00:00:07,140
In this part of the project,
you're gonna make your map interactive.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,100
So I wanna show you the functionality
that you'll be adding to your map.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,520
Basically the ability to interact
with these earthquake and

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,800
city markers using your mouse.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,860
So I've zoomed in.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,560
So I'm in an area of the world
where there have been a lot of

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,900
small earthquakes lately.

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,040
And that's here near
the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,660
And what you're gonna be able to see
is that when you hover your mouse

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,130
over the screen.

12
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,670
When you hover over an earthquake marker.

13
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,660
What you'll see is information
about that earthquake pop up.

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,560
So I hover over this one, I can see
that it's a magnitude 4.7 earthquake.

15
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,480
And it happened 37 kilometers north
west of La Concepcion, Venezuela.

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,050
I could also hover my mouse
over city markers and

17
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,840
see information about that city.

18
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,700
This is Caracas Venezuela and
the population is 3.27 million.

19
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,820
So that's what you're going to be
adding in terms of responding to mouse

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,170
hover events.

21
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,510
And you'll notice some
little weird things like,

22
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,250
when I hover over this earthquake
marker the text appears.

23
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,050
And the city marker is
drawn on top of that text.

24
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:12,200
That's actually surprisingly hard to fix,
and so don't worry about that for

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,630
the purpose of this assignment.

26
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,470
You're welcome to fix it if you want, but

27
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,470
if not, just go ahead and
leave it like that.

28
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,020
Now one thing you'll wanna make sure of,
is that when you have

29
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,948
multiple earthquake markers, or
multiple markers in a small area.

30
00:01:24,948 --> 00:01:29,150
You only wanna be showing information
about one of the markers at a time.

31
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,340
So you'll wanna test this out to
make sure that you're always showing

32
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,570
information about just one marker.

33
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,490
Now, the other thing that you're
going to implement is click it.

34
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,540
So when I click on a marker,

35
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,580
I can see that basically everything
else is going to go away.

36
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,500
So I click on that marker,
everything else goes away.

37
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,390
I click on it again,
everything else comes back.

38
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,400
Or in fact, if I click anywhere else,
everything else should come back.

39
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,330
And except in certain circumstances.

40
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,070
So if a city is close to an earthquake,

41
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,400
if the city could potentially
be effected by that earthquake.

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,360
By this definition of something called
a threat circle which is explained in

43
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,700
the project write up.

44
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:13,300
Then we want to keep that city shown
when I click on this earthquake.

45
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,560
So here I'll click on the earthquake.

46
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,880
And you can see that that city, Caracas,
can be effected by that earthquake.

47
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,660
Click again, everything comes back.

48
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,770
Similarly, when I click on the city
you can see the earthquakes that might

49
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,960
potentially effect it.

50
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,405
So I click on that city, and you can
see that that earthquake stays around.

51
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:33,630
Cause that earthquake might have
potentially effected people in Caracas.

52
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,320
All right.
So that's the interactivity you'll be

53
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,350
adding to your map.

54
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,880
And in this module's lessons.

55
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,810
You'll learn how to respond to events
in order to add that interactivity.
