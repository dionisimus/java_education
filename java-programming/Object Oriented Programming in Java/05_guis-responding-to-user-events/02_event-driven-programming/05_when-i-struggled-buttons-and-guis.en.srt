00:00:03,311 --> 00:00:07,120
So, one time I struggled
in computer science.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,670
Was actually at the end of high school.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,790
And I had to just make one button and

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,960
have it respond to being clicked and
[LAUGH] it was the most frustrating thing.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,850
Because I just remember,
we just got thrown into it and

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:27,430
I had to see what this event handler was.

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,635
There was so much terminology that
was coming in out of nowhere.

9
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:34,185
It wasn't until I sat down and

10
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:38,871
I kinda just I looked it up on YouTube and

11
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:47,114
I watched a few tutorials where I
watched them code it and explain it.

12
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:48,690
And that really helped me out.

13
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,353
And I realized that it wasn't as
complicated as I made it out to be,

14
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:56,000
because of all the big words.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,230
It's actually pretty simple
when you look at it.
