[MUSIC] So, one time I struggled
in computer science. Was actually at the end of high school. And I had to just make one button and have it respond to being clicked and
[LAUGH] it was the most frustrating thing. Because I just remember,
we just got thrown into it and I had to see what this event handler was. There was so much terminology that
was coming in out of nowhere. It wasn't until I sat down and I kinda just I looked it up on YouTube and I watched a few tutorials where I
watched them code it and explain it. And that really helped me out. And I realized that it wasn't as
complicated as I made it out to be, because of all the big words. It's actually pretty simple
when you look at it.
