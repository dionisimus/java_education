00:00:07,789 --> 00:00:09,440
Event processing is really common,

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,130
and you probably interact with
it more often than you realize.

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,338
So one real world example would be,
have you ever gone to a website and

5
00:00:17,338 --> 00:00:21,417
then all of a sudden it just started
running really, really slow?

6
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:26,362
And it's just grinding to a halt,
the user experience is awful and then all

7
00:00:26,362 --> 00:00:31,402
of a sudden the browser pops up a warning
and says the page is not responding.

8
00:00:31,402 --> 00:00:34,480
So you have to ask yourself,
what does that even mean?

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,510
What does it mean for
the page to be responding?

10
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,180
And usually what the browser
means by this is that

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,290
the JavaScript on the page
isn't handling events properly.

12
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,818
So, like a lot of things,
JavaScript is essentially handling events.

13
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:55,230
So the browser's sending
something like a keystroke and

14
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,190
expected it to finish dealing
with it pretty quickly.

15
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,406
Now if the page isn't responding,
an event came in and

16
00:01:03,406 --> 00:01:06,898
the JavaScript never finished handling it.

17
00:01:06,898 --> 00:01:09,990
It's probably caught in
an infinite loop some place.

18
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,790
Now, the browser doesn't need to know
exactly what the JavaScript's trying to do

19
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,020
with that event.

20
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,610
It just needs to notice that it
never finished running on it.

21
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,870
And this is kind of a running
theme with event processing,

22
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,540
is that you should be able to
handle an event pretty quickly.

23
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,750
You may have to generate things that'll
come back to you down the road,

24
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,990
like go get that image that you want
to get when a user clicks on it,

25
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,730
but that'll come in as an event too.

26
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:40,351
So there's no reason that your program
needs to wait around forever to process

27
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:43,936
the event, and the browser knows that,
and relies on this.

28
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:48,356
So if it ever notices that some JavaScript
code isn't finishing with an event

29
00:01:48,356 --> 00:01:50,872
quickly, it can go ahead and
warn the user,

30
00:01:50,872 --> 00:01:53,530
because this is probably
a programmer error.
