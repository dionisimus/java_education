00:00:00,322 --> 00:00:04,222
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04,222 --> 00:00:06,588
All right,
as you know in this part of the project,

3
00:00:06,588 --> 00:00:09,740
you'll be adding code to respond
to mouse clicks and mouse hovers.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,661
So let's take a look at what you
need to do to make that happen.

5
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:16,026
So here's the project write up and
I'll walk you through it a little bit and

6
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:18,160
talk about the starter code.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,350
So what you're gonna do is of course you
want your documentation pages open for

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,810
the unfoldingmaps javadoc and
the processing reference.

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,990
And the first thing to do is to just
find the starter code that's in module5.

10
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,930
And again,

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,550
we provide you with code that essentially
implements the module4 functionality.

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,786
Then you're actually going to, the first
thing you're going to do is you're going

13
00:00:38,786 --> 00:00:40,210
to be changing the class hierarchy.

14
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,630
And so in order to do that,
do the step 2 here.

15
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,091
You're gonna modify
the header in CityMarker so

16
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:50,370
that it extends this new class called
CommonMarker instead of SimplePointMarker.

17
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,550
And then we're gonna ask you to draw the
UML diagram for the new class hierarchy.

18
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,070
And part of your reflection and
what we'll ask you about

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,870
is why we made those changes and what
changes we made to the class hierarchy.

20
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,470
So spend some time really understanding
the new code and a new class hierarchy.

21
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,440
And when you do this change,
you're going to get a compile error.

22
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,540
So right here you'll see
a compile error in CityMarker and

23
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:19,150
we ask you to figure out why that compile
error occurred and how you can fix it.

24
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,039
And we've got some hints here and

25
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,153
then a little description
of what's really going on.

26
00:01:24,153 --> 00:01:28,040
All right so
then your ready to start coding.

27
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,570
And in order to add this interaction
you're going to be implementing

28
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,280
two methods in EarthquakeCityMap.

29
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,660
One is mouse moved and
the other is mouse clicked and

30
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,670
both of those have a little
bit of starter code in them.

31
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,490
And you'll be implementing
them to some degree.

32
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,910
So the first thing you're gonna do is
implement this selectifHover helper method

33
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,390
and that's called from
the mouseMoved() method.

34
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,480
So let's go over here to the starter code
to understand what's really going on here.

35
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,541
So in EarthquakeCityMap

36
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:59,470
that's where you'll find that
selectMarkerIfHover method.

37
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,770
So it's down here.

38
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:05,830
And as I mentioned it's called up
here from this mouseMoved() method.

39
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:13,020
And really the goal of selectMarkerIfHover
is to set the if selected to true on

40
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,980
that marker that's under the cursor, and
to only do it for one marker at a time.

41
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:23,210
So the goal of the selectMarkerIfHover is
to iterate through all the markers and

42
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:29,250
see if they are under the mouse cursor
at the moment that mouse X and mouse Y.

43
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,460
And if they are then for
the first one you find,

44
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,920
you will set that marker to be selected.

45
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,990
So how does that result in
displaying the title that you see

46
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,700
next to the marker when
you hover over a marker?

47
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,530
Well to understand that we need to go
over here to the ColumnMarker class and

48
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,790
look at its draw method.

49
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,480
So if we go down here to the draw method.

50
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,460
You can see that there is some
logic here that basically says

51
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,440
if that marker is selected,
then you're gonna show the title.

52
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,109
The showTitle is a method
you're going to write as well

53
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:02,570
to display that text next to the method.

54
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,580
So that's how this all comes together.

55
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:11,550
In EarthquakeCityMap we have this
mouseMoved() method that basically

56
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:17,200
clears the last selection and then finds
if another marker has been selected.

57
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,260
And again, just be careful to only ever
have one marker be selected at a time.

58
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,400
That's a little bit tricky.

59
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,020
There are some hints in
the project write-up.

60
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,970
So that's what you have to do to get
the hover functionality working.

61
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,100
Going back to the project description,

62
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,030
the next thing you'll wanna do is
to implement that showTitle method.

63
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,210
That's what, as we saw,

64
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:43,050
is going to actually be drawing
the text next to the earthquake marker.

65
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:49,110
And you will have to look into that
text method in the processing library.

66
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,870
Using the processing documentation that
you've seen in some of the support videos

67
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,600
to understand how to display
text next to each marker.

68
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,870
You'll just be using those
processing drawing methods.

69
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:05,205
All right, then once you have
your showTitle method working,

70
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:09,315
you should see your mouse actually
causing those titles to appear if

71
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:13,355
your selectMarkerIfHover method and
your showTitle method are both working.

72
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:14,230
So you'll wanna test that out.

73
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,516
The next piece is to implement
the mouseClicked method in

74
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:23,191
the EarthquakeCityMap so
that your EarthquakeMarkers and

75
00:04:23,191 --> 00:04:25,980
your CityMarkers respond to clicks.

76
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,262
And you can read the text here about
what that's supposed to do, and

77
00:04:29,262 --> 00:04:31,920
then there are some hints
about how to implement that.

78
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,790
But to show you where
this all is in the code,

79
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,986
we can go down right here
to the second TODO item.

80
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:43,540
And just look at where you're gonna put
your code that handles mouse clicks.

81
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,130
This is not a totally trivial method and
you'll want some helper methods

82
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,740
to keep mouse click from getting
too long or disorganized.

83
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,755
But essentially, you need to iterate
through the EarthquakeMarkers and

84
00:04:53,755 --> 00:04:55,970
the CityMarkers,
see if any have been clicked.

85
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,291
And then if they have, you'll need to do
some additional iteration to hide what

86
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:03,064
markers that aren't supposed
to be displayed, or

87
00:05:03,064 --> 00:05:07,011
to show the markers that are supposed
to be displayed at any given point.

88
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:09,905
Again, one thing to note
about the CommonMarker,

89
00:05:09,905 --> 00:05:14,831
since all of these are CommonMarkers, is
that they have this property, getClicked.

90
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:19,846
But also because they inherit from
SimplePointMarker which inherits

91
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:24,271
from this abstract marker class
they have a hidden property.

92
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:26,714
So you can set them to be hidden or
not and

93
00:05:26,714 --> 00:05:29,910
that's how you're actually
gonna do the hiding.

94
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:35,260
Because you'll note here in draw,
if this marker is not hidden,

95
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,570
then you're going to draw it but if it
is hidden, then it will not be drawn.

96
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,710
And that's something that's set
through the super classes, and

97
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,610
you can check out the documentation.

98
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,660
And we also give you some hints
here in the hints for step 7.

99
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,350
So that's it.

100
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,502
You have an option of adding
some additional functionality

101
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:55,660
to your responsiveness,
to your GUI if you like.

102
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,960
But other than that once you get through
step 7 you will finish the project

103
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,500
for this module.
