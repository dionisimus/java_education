  Is this course right for me?
 </h2>
 <p>
  This course is designated as Intermediate Level, with "some experience required."  But you're probably wondering just what experience, exactly, is required.  In this reading and the quiz that follows, we will try to help you determine whether or not you have the correct background for this course and this specialization.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you're coming to this course as the third course in the Object Oriented Programming in Java specialization after completing the first two courses with our colleagues from Duke, you're almost certainly ready for this course.  But just to make sure, make sure everything in the list below looks familiar to you.
 </p>
 <p>
  We assume that you have
  <strong>
   taken and passed a college-level introductory Java programming course designed for CS majors
  </strong>
  , or its online equivalent.  Topics in these courses typically include at least the following topics:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Variables and types
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Basic data types: Strings, ints, doubles, etc.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Loops (for, while, nested loops)
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Calling methods
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Writing methods (with and without return types, with and without parameters)
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Using objects and possibly designing them
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    1D and 2D arrays
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Basic input and output (System.out.println)
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Compiling and running Java code
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  One example of such a course is

  If the content on that page looks familiar to you, you're in good shape.

  Here at Coursera, we've designed this course to fit into two places: (1) as the first course in the
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented">
   Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond
  </a>
  specialization and (2) as the third course in the
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming">
   Object Oriented Programming in Java
  </a>
  specialization.   The
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented">
   Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond
  </a>
  specialization was designed as a follow on to the  "
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming">
   Java Programming: An Introduction to Software
  </a>
  " specialization, offered by Duke University.   So if you are brand new to programming you might want to start there first.  Or you can start with the first course in the
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming">
   Object Oriented Programming in Java
  </a>
  specialization (which is the second course in the Java Programming: An Introduction to Software specialization) if you've already got a little programming experience.
 </p>
 <h2 level="2">
  What if I have taken an introductory programming course, but it wasn't in Java?
 </h2>
 <p>
  If you have taken a course that covers all or most of the above topics, but it was in a language like C or C++, you will probably do fine in our specialization.  We recommend that you review Java syntax and some details of how Java works with objects using some basic online resources (e.g.
  <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_basic_syntax.htm">
   http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_basic_syntax.htm
  </a>
  ).
 </p>
 <p>
  If your introductory course was in a language like Scheme, Python or Javascript or another scripting language, you might still be OK, though it will be a bit more challenging because of the difference between Java and these languages.  You might try this course, but keep an open mind to falling back to the
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming">
   Duke specialization
  </a>
  if you find you are in over your head.

  Take the quiz for guidance...
 </h2>
 <p>
  Up next we've got a short quiz to help you figure out whether you're in the right place.  Feel free to skip it if you know this course is for you, or even ignore its results if you like.  It's just for your own information, and ultimately you should place yourself where you feel most comfortable and challenged.
