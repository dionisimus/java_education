00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,025
Hello again, I'm Mia Minnes and I'm
a Professor of Computer Science here at

3
00:00:08,025 --> 00:00:12,234
UC San Diego, and my background and
my research is at the intersection between

4
00:00:12,234 --> 00:00:16,600
mathematics and computer science,
between theory and applications.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,410
And what I really like to think
about is the power of algorithms.

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:25,030
I like to think about abstract ways of
organizing and structuring data, and then

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:30,750
applying them to really interesting real
world problems and solving those problems.

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,020
And you'll have the opportunity to do
just that in the project in this course.

9
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,210
And so what this video is about is showing
you a prototype of the project and

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,350
getting you really excited to jump right
in and get started developing yourself.

11
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,960
So, if you take a look
at this map over here

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,220
you'll get a picture of what you'll
be developing in the project.

13
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,940
And I'd like to start off by saying that
the machine, the engine under the hood

14
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,160
that helps us do the visualizations on
this map that you're seeing is really

15
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,100
thanks to Till Nagel and his team at the
University of Applied Sciences in Potsdam,

16
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,620
and all of the other contributors
to the Unfolding Maps Library.

17
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,220
Part of what we're thinking about and
developing in this course

18
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,330
is the ability to build large scale
projects using existing libraries.

19
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,860
And we're really fortunate to have this
library as the foundation for the project.

20
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,567
So let's take a look at the project and
see what we're doing.

21
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:26,340
You'll see,
we have a map of the world in front of us.

22
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,130
And there's all sorts of markers,
and features, and stuff on this map.

23
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,570
Now, don't worry.

24
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,480
We will walk you through
the project step by step so

25
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,980
don't be intimidated by the amount of
information that's being displayed.

26
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,440
I hope that you're inspired by
the amount of information, and

27
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,660
this information is real live data.

28
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,480
And so, it's really interesting
that by the end of this process,

29
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,970
you'll have a way of
interacting with live data, and

30
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,490
the data that we have in this project
is from earthquakes around the world.

31
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,161
It's put together by the USGS,
taking seismic information from all over.

32
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:10,640
And what we're doing in this visualization
is depicting each earthquake as

33
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,310
either a square or a circle on this map,
and then coloring that square or

34
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:22,460
circle on the map based on attributes
like magnitude, like depth and like time.

35
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,220
So, how long ago the earthquake happened.

36
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,320
So, all of that is encoded in this key.

37
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,790
And you will be able to create and style
your own legend as well and what that key

38
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:39,170
tells us is for example that this red
square marker over here is an earthquake

39
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,240
that happened in the middle of the ocean,
sort of south, close to Antarctica.

40
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,170
And it was a relatively
shallow earthquake.

41
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,499
And the fact that the square's not too
big, not too small means it was maybe

42
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:53,090
an average size in terms
of magnitude earthquake.

43
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,290
And then we also have interactivity built
into this project, which is really cool.

44
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,782
So, for example, if we have
hover on top of that red square,

45
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:05,270
we see a little pop-up that says that
this earthquake was magnitude 5.1.

46
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,810
Now, that's not the only interactivity.

47
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,789
So, for example,

48
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:12,358
we notice that there's a fair amount
of activity going over in Asia.

49
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:17,270
We can double-click on that part of
the world, and see that Japan, for

50
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,610
example, has a lot of markers around it.

51
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,010
And so, we could look around and

52
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,490
see that some of these earthquake
markers have xs on them.

53
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:29,300
And we look at the key and notice that
means they occurred in the past day.

54
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,010
And we might zero in on Tokyo,
for example.

55
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,060
And when we click on the triangle,
which depicts the city Tokyo,

56
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,340
notice that a bunch of earthquake markers
disappeared and only a few remained.

57
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,220
And so, in this project, you'll be able
to implement this interactive feature

58
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,970
that when we just wanna focus in on
a particular city, only earthquakes that

59
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,740
are close to that city stay visible,
and all the others disappear.

60
00:03:54,740 --> 00:04:00,300
And then if we click on Tokyo again,
everything comes back into view.

61
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,290
So, that's a taste for the project
that you're developing in this course.

62
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,950
It may seem somewhat complicated, like
it has a lot of features, and it does.

63
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:15,120
But what we'll be demonstrating throughout
this course is a really good approach for

64
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,970
dealing with large scale projects,

65
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,510
which is to break them up
into manageable pieces.

66
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,660
And the way we've done that follows
along with the modules of the course.

67
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,330
So, at the end of each module, the end
of module assessment will typically

68
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,680
be a part of the project that you'll be
implementing that uses the concepts and

69
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,530
the ideas that you're thinking about and
learning in that module.

70
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,850
And so you'll see how each time you
acquire a new piece of information, or

71
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,440
knowledge, or
skill to do with programming,

72
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,630
you'll be able to immediately
apply it in this project.

73
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,010
So, I hope you're as excited about this
project as I am, and let's get started.
