00:00:03,817 --> 00:00:07,224
Hi again, I'm Christine Alvarado and
in this video I'm gonna give you some

3
00:00:07,224 --> 00:00:10,540
information that will help you choose
your own path through this course.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,680
So, when I'm not teaching, what I like
to do is, I like to build programs and

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,270
curriculum that help bring in
a diverse set of learners to study and

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,650
work in the field of computer science.

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,370
And one thing I've learned about
reaching a diverse audience

8
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,540
is that you need diverse courses
with diverse support structures.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,630
So we've engineered this
diversity into our course and

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,815
into the whole specialization.

11
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:40,475
We know that you're coming to us with lots
of different motivations, backgrounds,

12
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:45,815
experience levels, so one size fits
all is not gonna work for this course.

13
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:47,875
And, that's okay, that's actually great.

14
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,725
We love that you're coming from
all these different backgrounds.

15
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:54,125
And what we want, is for each of you
to feel challenged, because otherwise,

16
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,580
what's the point?

17
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,350
But also never to feel overwhelmed.

18
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,930
We want it to be the case where when
you feel like you're starting to get

19
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,350
overwhelmed, you can always have some more
support, to help you with your learning.

20
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,090
What we've designed is a course where
we have different video styles,

21
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,980
different video series
to help meet that goal.

22
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,030
So you're not going to want to take
this course by just sitting down and

23
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,450
watching the videos one after another.

24
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,020
What you're going to
want to do is pick and

25
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,950
choose a path through the videos
that's right for you.

26
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,580
And to help you do that, I'm gonna tell
you about our different video series.

27
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,160
But first I wanna say that at the end of
the day, it's all about what you can do.

28
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,010
Mia described this really cool project
that you're gonna be doing throughout

29
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:33,970
this course.

30
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,820
And that's really what we
want you to be able to do.

31
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,310
So what we care most about, are these
end of module assessments which are,

32
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,220
a lot of the time, going to have you
building a piece of that project.

33
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,200
So if you're feeling really advanced,

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,680
really good about the material,
always feel free to race ahead and

35
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,290
just start working on that project or
do the end of module assessment.

36
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,550
But if you want a little instruction,

37
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,740
which most of you will,
you'll wanna watch some of the videos.

38
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,680
So the first video series that I'm gonna
tell you about is our core content series.

39
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,700
So these are the videos that
we expect everybody to watch.

40
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,830
They're mostly lecture style and they're
gonna introduce you to the core concepts

41
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,980
and skills that you're going to need
to do the end of module assessments.

42
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,020
Once you've watched those videos,

43
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:25,260
we're gonna probe your knowledge a bit
more with our concept challenge series.

44
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,110
Again we encourage most
learners to watch these videos.

45
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,150
And what they're going to do is they're
going to ask you to think about

46
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,760
the material you just
learned in a new way.

47
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,774
And Leah is gonna tell you more about
these concept challenges in just a minute.

48
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:43,250
The next series that we have for
you are additional support videos.

49
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,080
Now, we don't expect everybody
to watch these videos.

50
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,370
These videos are designed for if,
after watching the core content, and

51
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,340
doing this concept challenges, you don't
quite feel ready to tackle the end of

52
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,299
module assessments, you might want to
watch these additional support videos.

53
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,190
The last two video series that we have,
we're really excited about.

54
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,490
These are series that aren't
designed to deliver content, so

55
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,830
much as to put the content that
you're learning in context.

56
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,810
So, the first of these series is called,
In the Real World.

57
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,690
And we've got a team of real life
Google engineers talking about

58
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,680
why what you're learning is important,
in their work at Google and

59
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,060
in general in the software industry.

60
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,190
So that'll be a really good opportunity
for you to learn, not only why what you're

61
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,920
learning is important, but how it's
important to these individual engineers.

62
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,200
And then the last series that we have for
you is called, When I struggled.

63
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,700
And what you're going to see in this
series is a number of UC San Diego

64
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,650
learners as well as us,
talking about our own experience

65
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,490
learning the material that you're
gonna be learning during this course.

66
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:53,040
We'll talk about a time where we struggled
with the material that we're presenting,

67
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,840
and then we'll talk about how
we overcame these struggles.

68
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,580
So we hope you'll watch
both of those series and

69
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,149
that it'll enrich your
experience in this course.

70
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,150
So again, to summarize, the standard
path we imagine a learner taking to this

71
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,980
course, is that you would watch
this introduction with the Google

72
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,400
engineers talking about why these
concepts are important in the real world.

73
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,980
You would go through and
watch the Core Concept videos and

74
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,010
perform these concept challenges,

75
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,390
maybe watching some videos about when some
learners struggled with these concepts.

76
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,910
Along the way, and then perform
the module-level assessment, and

77
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,860
you would repeat that for each module.

78
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,750
But if you're feeling more advanced, you
might just wanna race right through those

79
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,170
core concept videos and get to that
end of module assessment faster and

80
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,690
get developing on those projects.

81
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,000
And we encourage you to do that,
if you're feeling comfortable.

82
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,960
And again, if you feel like you
need a little more support,

83
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,520
you've got those support
videos available to you.

84
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,930
So any time you feel like you don't
quite understand what's going on,

85
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,680
you need a little more help, go ahead and
pull out those support videos and

86
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,530
we hope that you'll find
the support that you need.

87
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,931
So choose the path that's right for
you, challenge yourself, and have fun.
