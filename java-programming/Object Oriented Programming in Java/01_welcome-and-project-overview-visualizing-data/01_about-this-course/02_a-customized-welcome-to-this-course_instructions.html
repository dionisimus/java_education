 <p>
  Welcome to this course on Object Oriented Programming in Java.  This course is in two different specializations: It is the first course in the
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented">
   Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond
  </a>
  Specialization and the third course in the
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming">
   Object Oriented Programming in Java
  </a>
  Specialization.  The former specialization provides you with a wider introduction to the broad set of Data Structures computer scientists rely on, while the latter specialization gives you a more focused introduction to core Java Programming skills (with some data structures).
 </p>
 <p>
  We want to provide you with the appropriate welcome in the context of the specialization you are participating in, so to start things off, you'll choose your own introductory video!  (In fact, you'll find we've designed this course to allow you to choose the path that's right for you throughout the course... more on that soon).
