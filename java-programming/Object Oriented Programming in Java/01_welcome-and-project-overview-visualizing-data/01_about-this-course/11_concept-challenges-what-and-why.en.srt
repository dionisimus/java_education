00:00:03,626 --> 00:00:05,298
Hi again, I'm Leo Porter.

3
00:00:05,298 --> 00:00:07,992
I'm a computer science
professor here at UC San Diego.

4
00:00:07,992 --> 00:00:10,826
One of my areas of research is
computer science education.

5
00:00:10,826 --> 00:00:14,669
What we like to do in that area of
research is look at the best practices for

6
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:16,631
student learning in the classroom.

7
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:21,250
One of the best practices we know about
in computer science is peer instruction.

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,679
With peer instruction,

9
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:26,827
students get to tackle hard problems,
discuss it with their peers, and

10
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:30,922
then participate in a large classwide
discussion with the professor.

11
00:00:30,922 --> 00:00:33,928
We do this in a number of the courses
here at UC San Diego, and

12
00:00:33,928 --> 00:00:35,566
we'd like to bring this to you.

13
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:40,866
And we're gonna do this through a series
of videos known as the Concept Challenges,

14
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:43,345
so let me walk through an example here.

15
00:00:43,345 --> 00:00:47,765
So here we have you watching a video,
now let's assume this is from a previous

16
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:52,400
class in Java that you've taken before
where you learned first about for loops.

17
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,915
So, you watch the video on for loops,
and then you get done with the video and

18
00:00:57,915 --> 00:01:00,553
the question becomes well,
did you learn it?

19
00:01:00,553 --> 00:01:02,944
I mean, there's certainly areas of the
video that you probably understood well.

20
00:01:02,944 --> 00:01:05,313
But there may be some areas that
you didn't understand as well.

21
00:01:05,313 --> 00:01:06,874
So the best way to find out whether or

22
00:01:06,874 --> 00:01:09,595
not you really understood
the material is to solve problems.

23
00:01:09,595 --> 00:01:13,660
So we're gonna ask you questions to help
elucidate what areas you're strongest in

24
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,121
and which areas you're not.

25
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,829
So a question might look
something like this, so

26
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:23,805
you've just watched a video on for
loops and here's an example of for loops.

27
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:29,190
And the question here is asking,
how many times does i<10 execute?

28
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,934
Now the reason we ask a question like this
is because we expect a number of folks

29
00:01:32,934 --> 00:01:33,983
will get this wrong.

30
00:01:33,983 --> 00:01:36,872
In fact, we want you to get a number of
these question wrong because that means

31
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:38,255
it's an opportunity for learning.

32
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:42,249
What we expect is a lot of novice
learners would answer B here.

33
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:47,868
They would say that the loop executes ten
times, so i<10 will execute ten times.

34
00:01:47,868 --> 00:01:51,606
But the condition i<10
actually executes 11 times.

35
00:01:51,606 --> 00:01:54,137
And we'll talk more about
that as we go forward.

36
00:01:54,137 --> 00:01:56,359
So after you solve
the problem on your own,

37
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:00,437
after you've tackled the problem yourself,
what you're gonna then see, or

38
00:02:00,437 --> 00:02:04,250
what we hope you can do,
is work with other learners around you.

39
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,227
So if you have anyone else in your
neighborhood, or friends who have taken

40
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:10,460
the same course, this is a great time to
get together and discuss the question.

41
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,708
And by discussing it with your friends,
you're gonna find out one of you may say,

42
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,893
well, wait a second,
does it execute that last time?

43
00:02:15,893 --> 00:02:20,049
And then you realize, oh, shoot,
it does actually execute 11 times.

44
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:22,741
But if you don't have
some friends around you,

45
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:27,520
what we're gonna give you is also a series
of videos where you're seeing UC San Diego

46
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,160
learners discussing the question.

47
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,030
And there you'll hear them
say things like, well,

48
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,170
wait a second, it's really easy
to forget that last check.

49
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,549
Oh, yeah, so the answer must have been 11.

50
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,300
And then, after you hear
the UC San Diego learners discussing it,

51
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,300
you're gonna hear one of our explanations.

52
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,590
So the full course of one of
these questions is gonna look

53
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,830
something like this.

54
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,790
You're gonna pause,
try solving the problem yourself,

55
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,440
you're gonna discuss the question with
other learners around you if you can,

56
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,090
you're either then gonna watch a video of
the UC San Diego learners discussing it.

57
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,530
And then you're gonna confirm your
understanding by listening to our

58
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,130
explanation.

59
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,620
By solving these kind of hard problems,

60
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,800
you're gonna understand
your material much better.

61
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,386
You're also gonna identify areas
that you might need improvement.

62
00:03:10,386 --> 00:03:13,567
And that's where more support videos and
the forums come in.
