00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,480
Hi, I'm Christine Alvarado.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,690
>> I'm Leo Porter.

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,360
>> And I'm Mia Minnes.

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:05,910
>> Welcome.

5
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,530
We're so glad you're joining us for
the third course in the specialization.

6
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,320
We hope you enjoyed learning Java
programming from our excellent colleagues

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,630
at Duke and that you're ready
to extend your skills further.

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,010
We'll start where you left off by
looking at the details of designing and

9
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,250
implementing classes in Java.

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,762
We'll start by refreshing some of
the basics and then move on to core object

11
00:00:24,762 --> 00:00:28,370
oriented concepts like class hierarchies,
inheritance and polymorphism.

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,280
>> Just like in the Duke courses,

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,090
you'll be building projects
with real world relevance.

14
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,345
You'll notice though,
as your programming skills are ramping up,

15
00:00:37,345 --> 00:00:38,978
the projects get more ambitious.

16
00:00:38,978 --> 00:00:43,588
In this class you'll be visualizing
earthquake data live on a map.

17
00:00:43,588 --> 00:00:47,635
You'll be able to build a core project,
and then customize and personalize it, and

18
00:00:47,635 --> 00:00:51,960
then have the opportunity to share it
with a broader learning community.

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,420
Throughout the course you'll also hear
from industry professionals about how they

20
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,870
use object oriented programming,
like you're learning in this class,

21
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:00,459
in their career.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,330
>> You'll also find a number of new
elements in our courses, as well.

23
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,880
First, we're going to be switching
from BlueJ to Eclipse as the preferred

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,150
programming environment.

25
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,480
If you don't have any experience
in Eclipse, that's totally fine,

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,810
we'll give you the help
you need when you need it.

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,320
Secondly, we're going to be introducing
a number of new video series.

28
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,990
The first of these is
called concept challenges.

29
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,460
In concept challenge videos you'll be
learning alongside UC San Diego students

30
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,900
as you tackle challenging problems.

31
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,050
We'll give you more details about these
new video series in the upcoming videos.

32
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,882
Lastly, we know you come to us with
different programming backgrounds.

33
00:01:34,882 --> 00:01:37,837
Those of you who are more comfortable
with programming, feel free to move more

34
00:01:37,837 --> 00:01:40,544
quickly through the course focusing
on the programming assignments.

35
00:01:40,544 --> 00:01:42,035
To those of you with less experience,

36
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,000
we'll give you the help
you need when you need it.

37
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,090
Many of the courses on Coursera allow you
to pick the pace that's right for you.

38
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,260
We're helping you find the path
that's right for you as well.

39
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,000
So let's get started.
