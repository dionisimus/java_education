00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,550
>> Hi, I am Christine Alvarado.

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:02,560
>> I'm Mia Minnes.

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,800
>> I'm Leo Porter and we're all professors of

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,845
Computer Science here the University of California San Diego.

5
00:00:07,845 --> 00:00:10,270
Welcome to our specialization on Java programming,

6
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,385
object-oriented design, and data structures.

7
00:00:12,385 --> 00:00:15,090
But before we start talking about our specialization, I will tell you a brief story.

8
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,285
Back in 2008, Google unveiled Flu Trends which is

9
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:21,820
a really neat idea that you could predict flu outbreaks based on search terms.

10
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,152
What it really just meant was a bunch of people in San Diego start

11
00:00:24,152 --> 00:00:26,865
searching for terms like fever or chills,

12
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:29,340
you predict an outbreak is coming to San Diego soon.

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,895
What really made this exciting was you can

14
00:00:30,895 --> 00:00:32,880
predict it long before traditional measurements,

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,630
which relied on folks going to the hospital or to a medical center.

16
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,955
>> So that's really cool. But why are we talking about the flu

17
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:41,555
in a specialization on programming and data structures?

18
00:00:41,555 --> 00:00:43,830
Well there are two connections between that story and

19
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,305
the specialization. And the first is data.

20
00:00:46,305 --> 00:00:47,760
In order to make those predictions,

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,105
Google needed lots and lots of data.

22
00:00:50,105 --> 00:00:51,765
And that's something we have today,

23
00:00:51,765 --> 00:00:54,060
all around us from weather sensors,

24
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,230
to social networks, to the human genome.

25
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,015
We're practically swimming in data.

26
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:00,360
But it's not enough just to have that data.

27
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,525
We need to be able to process it efficiently and effectively.

28
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:07,785
And that idea of processing data efficiently and effectively

29
00:01:07,785 --> 00:01:11,805
is really at the heart of software development and computer science.

30
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,160
>> And it's what you'll be doing in

31
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,400
these four courses and the Capstone Project of the specialization.

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,920
So we'll be talking about object-oriented programming.

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,640
We'll be talking about both basic and advanced data structures and then we'll be

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,750
talking about analyzing the algorithms and thinking about correctness and efficiency.

35
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,525
Once we've got the technical background in place,

36
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:32,855
we'll also bring that to the workplace.

37
00:01:32,855 --> 00:01:36,570
We'll think about interview skills and we'll think about avenues for

38
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,935
success when you're working in a software engineering or related job.

39
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:42,705
In an academic setting,

40
00:01:42,705 --> 00:01:44,040
like on campus here,

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,440
we would call this course a gateway course.

42
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,125
A gateway to what? Well, to Computer Science as a field.

43
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,855
Once you've mastered the foundations,

44
00:01:51,855 --> 00:01:54,720
you're ready to delve into whatever you're interested in.

45
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,900
Whether that be artificial intelligence, cryptography,

46
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,150
security, bioinformatics, the world is open to you.

47
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:08,465
>> Welcome to this first course on object-oriented programming and user interfaces.

48
00:02:08,465 --> 00:02:10,350
In this course, you're going to get to learn how to

49
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,750
design graphical interfaces, handle user input,

50
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,090
design class hierarchies including inheritance and

51
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,610
polymorphism and begin thinking about program efficiency.

52
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,080
>> And you'll be doing all of this in the context of a really cool project.

53
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,230
So, you'll be reading an earthquake data from around the world in

54
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,970
real time and then mapping that data onto a picture of the real world map.

55
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,915
And then what you'll do is make this map interactive, customize it,

56
00:02:33,915 --> 00:02:38,130
personalize it, and share it with your fellow learners and the world.

57
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,260
>> Speaking of personalization,

58
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,750
we recognize that you're coming to us with different backgrounds

59
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,010
and different comfort levels with programming and computer science.

60
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,405
We expect that you've all had some basic course in Java programming

61
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:51,030
but that doesn't mean that you'll work through

62
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,670
this course or the specialization at the same speed.

63
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,535
If you're more comfortable and you've had more experience,

64
00:02:56,535 --> 00:03:00,435
you'll be able to work through the courses faster and focus on that project.

65
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:03,000
If you need a little more support, that's also fine.

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,180
There's a path that will provide you with that extra support.

67
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,875
Most MOOCs are self-paced,

68
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,650
but we're here to provide you with some guidance to

69
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,665
find the path through this course and the specialization that's right for you.

70
00:03:14,665 --> 00:03:16,410
So without further ado,

71
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,335
this first module's going to dive right into that project that Mia just told you about.

72
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:23,000
It's going to be a lot of fun. So let's get started.
