[MUSIC] As a software engineer, I use
the words private and public everyday. Even though it might sound trivial, it's
extremely important to get those right. You make everything private and you end up with code that cannot
interact with anything else. You make everything public and you end up with code that's extremely
vulnerable, maybe even useless.
