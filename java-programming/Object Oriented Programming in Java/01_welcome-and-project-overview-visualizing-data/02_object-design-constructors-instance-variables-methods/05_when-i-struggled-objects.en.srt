2
00:00:03,643 --> 00:00:06,977
All right, so when I was first learning
about objects, I was taking this class and

3
00:00:06,977 --> 00:00:09,843
the professor was at the front of
the room talking to us about objects.

4
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,639
And he kept saying objects this and
objects that, and

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,950
I just kept getting more and
more confused.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,969
I'm sitting there thinking,
objects, they're like things.

7
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:20,070
But, what the heck is an object?

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,649
And finally, I got up the nerve to
raise my hand and ask the professor,

9
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,620
what is an object?

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,760
And he kind of looked at me with this look
on his face like, oh dear, where have I

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,970
gone wrong with this poor student that
she doesn't know what an object is?

12
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,610
But he was very patient with me,
explained what an object is, and after he

13
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,958
explained it, I realized that I actually
knew more about objects than I thought.

14
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:47,412
I just hadn't necessarily associated
the word object with the concept that I

15
00:00:47,412 --> 00:00:49,412
already knew a fair amount about.

16
00:00:49,412 --> 00:00:52,639
So that was kind of an example
of vocabulary tripping me up.

17
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:57,364
And as I learned a little bit more, and
got more sophisticated with designing and

18
00:00:57,364 --> 00:01:00,230
implementing objects,
it all made more sense.

19
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:03,180
I look back now, and I wonder how
I could have possibly struggled

20
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,480
with something that seems so
simple to me now.

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,410
But that's how it is when
you're first starting out.
