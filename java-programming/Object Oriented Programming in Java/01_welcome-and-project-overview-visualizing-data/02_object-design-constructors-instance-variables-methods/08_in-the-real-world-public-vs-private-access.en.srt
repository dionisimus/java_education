00:00:06,988 --> 00:00:11,770
As a software engineer, I use
the words private and public everyday.

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,870
Even though it might sound trivial, it's
extremely important to get those right.

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,240
You make everything private and

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,250
you end up with code that cannot
interact with anything else.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,151
You make everything public and

7
00:00:23,151 --> 00:00:27,694
you end up with code that's extremely
vulnerable, maybe even useless.
